is that bash already install on my ubuntu cli command shell


Yes! **Bash (Bourne Again SHell)** is the default command-line shell in **Ubuntu** (and most Linux distributions).  

### How to Check if Bash is Installed:
1. **Check Bash Version** (confirm it's installed):  
   ```sh
   bash --version
   ```
   - If installed, it will show something like:  
     ```sh
     GNU bash, version 5.1.16(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
     ```

2. **Check Current Shell**:  
   ```sh
   echo $SHELL
   ```
   - If it returns `/bin/bash`, you're already using Bash.

3. **List Available Shells**:  
   ```sh
   cat /etc/shells
   ```
   - This shows all installed shells (e.g., `/bin/bash`, `/bin/sh`, `/bin/zsh`).

### If Bash is Missing (Unlikely in Ubuntu):
If for some reason Bash isn't installed (very rare), you can install it with:  
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install bash
```

But **you donâ€™t need to**â€”Ubuntu comes with Bash pre-installed. ðŸ˜Š
