Sure. Here’s a **step-by-step guide to install the open-source version of PF\_RING** on a Linux system (such as Ubuntu). PF\_RING is a high-speed packet capture and filtering framework by ntop.

---

### ✅ Prerequisites

Before installing PF\_RING:

* Recommended OS: **Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04**
* Ensure you have kernel headers and build tools installed.
* Internet connection to clone the GitHub repository.

---

### 🧰 Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open a terminal and install required packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential git linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

---

### 🧾 Step 2: Clone PF\_RING Repository

Clone the official PF\_RING GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ntop/PF_RING.git
cd PF_RING
```

---

### ⚙️ Step 3: Build PF\_RING Core

This compiles the kernel module and user-space library.

```bash
cd kernel
make
```

> This builds the kernel module `pf_ring.ko`.

To install it:

```bash
sudo make install
sudo insmod ./pf_ring.ko
```

You can verify it loaded with:

```bash
lsmod | grep pf_ring
```

Or check logs:

```bash
dmesg | grep pf_ring
```

---

### 🧪 Step 4: Build User-Space Tools

Go back to the base PF\_RING directory and build user tools:

```bash
cd ../userland/lib
make
sudo make install
```

Now build applications:

```bash
cd ../examples
make
```

This will build sample applications like `pfcount`, `pfbridge`, etc.

---

### 🧪 Step 5: Run a Test (e.g., pfcount)

Use `pfcount` to test packet capture performance:

```bash
sudo ./pfcount -i eth0
```

Replace `eth0` with your network interface name. To list interfaces:

```bash
ip link show
```

---

### ✅ Step 6: Load on Boot (Optional)

If you want to load PF\_RING module at boot:

```bash
echo pf_ring | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
```

To install the module system-wide:

```bash
sudo cp kernel/pf_ring.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/net/
sudo depmod -a
```

---

### 🚫 Licensing Note

The **zero-copy features and high-performance drivers (like ZC)** are **not open source**. This guide installs only the **open-source core**.

If you later want to evaluate ZC (closed-source), you must register at [ntop.org](https://www.ntop.org/products/packet-capture/pf_ring/) and get evaluation binaries.
