why in virtual box my machine that has ubuntu on it suddenlly get into problem and start up get very slow and the shutdown also takes too time
{

There are several reasons why an Ubuntu VM in VirtualBox could suddenly start booting and shutting down very slowly. Let’s go through the most common causes and how to check/fix them:

---

### 1. **Disk Space Issues**

* If the VM’s virtual disk is nearly full, Ubuntu will slow down dramatically, especially during boot and shutdown.
* **Check inside the VM:**

```bash
df -h
```

* Look at the `% Used` column for the root filesystem (`/`).

**Fix:** Free up space or expand the virtual disk.

---

### 2. **Corrupted File System or Swap**

* An unclean shutdown or disk issues can make the file system check run at boot, slowing startup.
* **Check logs:**

```bash
sudo journalctl -b -1
```

* Look for errors related to filesystem or swap.

**Fix:** Run a filesystem check:

```bash
sudo fsck /dev/sda1   # Replace with your root partition
```

* If swap is corrupted, disable and recreate it.

---

### 3. **Updates or Package Issues**

* If a previous update was interrupted, systemd may spend extra time trying to configure packages.

```bash
sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

---

### 4. **Heavy Services or Startup Programs**

* Check which services delay boot:

```bash
systemd-analyze blame
systemd-analyze critical-chain
```

* Look for unusually long-running services.

**Fix:** Disable unnecessary services:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable <service_name>
```

---

### 5. **VirtualBox Settings**

* Sometimes VirtualBox resource settings can cause slow VM performance:

  * **CPU:** Ensure VM has at least 2 cores assigned.
  * **RAM:** At least 2–4 GB for modern Ubuntu.
  * **Storage controller:** Use SATA or NVMe instead of IDE.
  * **3D acceleration:** Disable if not needed; can cause long shutdown sometimes.

---

### 6. **Snapshots**

* If your VM has many snapshots, especially old or large ones, VirtualBox performance can degrade.
* **Fix:** Delete unnecessary snapshots (after backup).

---

### 7. **Log Accumulation**

* Ubuntu stores system logs in `/var/log`. Excessive logs can slow down boot/shutdown.

```bash
sudo du -sh /var/log
```

* Clear old logs if needed:

```bash
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d
```

---

### 8. **Hardware Issues**

* Host machine load, disk I/O, or memory pressure can slow down the VM.
* Check host performance during VM boot/shutdown.

by the "systemd-analyze blame" i get this result "2min 99ms systemd-networkd-wait-online.service". what is that and how to improve it
{

Ah! That explains the slow boot. Let me break it down carefully.

---

### **What is `systemd-networkd-wait-online.service`?**

* This service **waits for network interfaces to be fully up** before continuing with other boot tasks.
* It’s usually used when some services **need a network connection at boot**, like NFS mounts, Docker, or servers.
* By default, it can **wait up to 2 minutes** (120 seconds) if the network is slow or misconfigured.

In your case, it waited **\~2 minutes**, which is why your VM boot feels slow.

---

### **Why it might take so long**

1. The VM’s network interface is misconfigured.
2. The network isn’t immediately available (e.g., NAT or bridged interface in VirtualBox is slow to initialize).
3. The service is waiting for a network that doesn’t exist (like a static IP on an interface that isn’t connected).

---

### **How to improve it**

#### **Option 1: Disable the wait if your VM doesn’t need it**

```bash
sudo systemctl disable systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
```

* This **won’t disable networking**, just stops systemd from waiting at boot.
* Boot time should drop immediately by \~2 minutes.

#### **Option 2: Reduce the timeout**

* Edit the service to wait less:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
```

* Add:

```
[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=10
```

* Save and exit. Now it will wait at most 10 seconds.

#### **Option 3: Check your network setup**

* Make sure the VM’s network is properly configured:

```bash
ip a
nmcli device status
```

* For simple desktop usage, using **NAT** or **Bridged Adapter** usually avoids delays.
* If using `systemd-networkd` with static IPs, check `/etc/systemd/network/*.network`.

---

✅ **Recommendation for VirtualBox Ubuntu VMs:**

* Most desktop VMs don’t need `systemd-networkd-wait-online.service`. Disabling it is safe and usually solves the 2-min boot delay.

When your Ubuntu virtual machine in VirtualBox boots quickly with a network connection but takes at least 2 minutes to boot when the network is disabled, the issue is likely related to the system waiting for a network connection during the boot process. This delay is typically caused by services or configurations that expect a network to be available and time out when it isn't. Here's a detailed explanation and steps to resolve the issue:

### Why This Happens
1. **Systemd Services Waiting for Network**:
   - Ubuntu uses `systemd` to manage services during boot. Some services, like `systemd-networkd` or `NetworkManager-wait-online`, are configured to wait for a network connection before proceeding. When the network is disabled, these services wait until a timeout period (often 90–120 seconds) before continuing the boot process.
   - Common culprits include:
     - `systemd-networkd-wait-online.service`
     - `NetworkManager-wait-online.service`
     - Other services that depend on network availability, such as NFS mounts, remote file systems, or network-dependent applications.

2. **Network Configuration Issues**:
   - If your network configuration (e.g., in `/etc/netplan/`) specifies a static IP or expects a DHCP server, the system may wait for a response from a non-existent network interface when the network is disabled.

3. **VirtualBox Network Adapter Settings**:
   - VirtualBox's network adapter settings (e.g., NAT, Bridged, or Host-Only) may affect how the virtual machine detects a network. If the network adapter is enabled but no network is available, Ubuntu may still attempt to configure it, leading to delays.

4. **Hostname Resolution**:
   - Ubuntu may try to resolve its hostname or connect to a domain during boot, which can cause delays if no network is available (e.g., if `/etc/hosts` is misconfigured or DNS servers are unreachable).

5. **Other Dependencies**:
   - Services like time synchronization (`systemd-timesyncd`), package updates, or cloud-init (common in Ubuntu server images) may attempt to access the network, causing delays when the network is unavailable.

### How to Fix the Issue
To reduce or eliminate the 2-minute boot delay when the network is disabled, try the following steps:

#### 1. Disable Network Wait Services
Check if services like `NetworkManager-wait-online` or `systemd-networkd-wait-online` are causing the delay.

- **Check Active Services**:
  Run the following command to see which services are taking time during boot:
  ```bash
  systemd-analyze blame
  ```
  Look for services related to networking, such as `NetworkManager-wait-online.service` or `systemd-networkd-wait-online.service`.

- **Disable NetworkManager-wait-online**:
  If `NetworkManager-wait-online.service` is running, disable it:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service
  ```

- **Disable systemd-networkd-wait-online**:
  If `systemd-networkd-wait-online.service` is running, disable it:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl disable systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
  ```

- **Verify Changes**:
  Reboot the virtual machine with the network disabled and check if the boot time improves.

#### 2. Configure Netplan for Optional Network
Ubuntu uses Netplan for network configuration. If your Netplan configuration expects a network interface, you can mark it as optional to prevent delays.

- Open the Netplan configuration file (e.g., `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml`):
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
  ```

- Add or modify the `optional: true` parameter for your network interface. Example:
  ```yaml
  network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
      enp0s3:
        dhcp4: true
        optional: true
  ```

- Apply the changes:
  ```bash
  sudo netplan apply
  ```

- Reboot to test.

#### 3. Check and Configure `/etc/hosts`
Ensure that your hostname is properly configured to avoid delays in hostname resolution.

- Open `/etc/hosts`:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/hosts
  ```

- Ensure there’s an entry for `localhost` and your hostname. For example:
  ```text
  127.0.0.1   localhost
  127.0.1.1   your-hostname
  ```
  Replace `your-hostname` with the actual hostname of your VM (check with `hostname`).

- Save and reboot to test.

#### 4. Disable Cloud-Init (If Applicable)
If you’re using an Ubuntu cloud image, `cloud-init` may be waiting for network connectivity. You can disable or configure it to not wait for a network.

- Check if `cloud-init` is running:
  ```bash
  systemctl status cloud-init
  ```

- Disable network dependency in `cloud-init`:
  Edit `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg` and ensure the `network` section doesn’t require connectivity. Alternatively, disable `cloud-init` entirely:
  ```bash
  sudo touch /etc/cloud/cloud-init.disabled
  ```

- Reboot to test.

#### 5. Adjust VirtualBox Network Settings
Ensure the VirtualBox network adapter is appropriately configured:

- Open VirtualBox and select your Ubuntu VM.
- Go to **Settings > Network > Adapter 1**.
- If you don’t need a network, set the adapter to **Not Attached** instead of leaving it enabled with no connection.
- If you need a network occasionally, use **NAT** or **Bridged Adapter** and ensure the guest OS is configured to handle missing networks gracefully (as described above).

#### 6. Check for Other Network-Dependent Services
Some services, like NFS mounts or time synchronization, may also cause delays. Check for these:

- **NFS Mounts**:
  Inspect `/etc/fstab` for network-based mounts:
  ```bash
  cat /etc/fstab
  ```
  If there are NFS or other network mounts, add the `nofail` option to prevent boot delays:
  ```text
  server:/share /mnt/share nfs nofail 0 0
  ```

- **Time Synchronization**:
  If `systemd-timesyncd` is waiting for a network, configure it to proceed without one:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd
  ```
  Or adjust its configuration in `/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf` to reduce timeouts.

#### 7. Update and Test
Ensure your system is up to date, as older versions of Ubuntu or VirtualBox may have bugs contributing to the issue:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

After applying these changes, reboot the VM with the network disabled and monitor the boot time. You can use `systemd-analyze` to measure boot time:
```bash
systemd-analyze
```

### Additional Notes
- **VirtualBox Version**: Ensure you’re using the latest version of VirtualBox, as older versions may have issues with network handling in VMs.
- **Guest Additions**: Install VirtualBox Guest Additions in the Ubuntu VM to improve performance and compatibility:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso
  ```
  Mount the Guest Additions ISO in VirtualBox and follow the installation instructions.
- **Debugging Boot Delays**: If the issue persists, check the boot log for clues:
  ```bash
  journalctl -b
  ```
  Look for services or processes that are timing out.

### Summary
The 2-minute boot delay is likely caused by `systemd` services waiting for a network connection. Disabling `NetworkManager-wait-online` or `systemd-networkd-wait-online`, marking network interfaces as optional in Netplan, and ensuring proper hostname configuration should resolve the issue.
