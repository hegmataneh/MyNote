is that very bried and useful to learn linux ubuntu in few time. and its self study and can read in in two days. i'd like to be like beej book abount socket programming and very usefull
{
	If you want something short, practical, and focused (like Beej’s Guide but for Linux basics), here are a few options:

	1. **“The Linux Command Line” by William Shotts (first few chapters)**

	   * Covers essential commands, navigation, permissions, editing, scripting.
	   * You can read the first 5–6 chapters in two days and get 80% of what you need to work effectively.

	2. **“Linux Journey” (linuxjourney.com)**

	   * Free, bite‑sized lessons.
	   * You can skip advanced sections and just do “Grasshopper” and “Journeyman” levels for a quick foundation.

	3. **“Ubuntu Pocket Guide and Reference” by Keir Thomas** (free PDF)

	   * Around 160 pages, dense but concise.
	   * Written exactly for people who need quick, practical knowledge.

	If you want **the fastest route (2‑day crash course)**:

	* Day 1: Filesystem layout, command line, package management (`apt`), systemd services, networking basics (`ip`, `ifconfig`, `ping`, `netstat`).
	* Day 2: Permissions, users/groups, SSH, processes (`ps`, `top`), logs, and compiling/installing software.

	Do you want me to **make you a two‑day reading plan with exact chapters/sections from one of these resources** so you can follow it step by step? Or do you want a **single cheat sheet PDF to read in one sitting**?

}

please explain more about 2‑day crash course and how can i read about these subject brifly that i can overlay the problem that may incounter

Here’s how you can approach a **two‑day Linux crash course** so you learn enough to solve most issues you’ll hit when working with Ubuntu for development, networking, and admin tasks:

---

## **Day 1: Core Navigation and System Use**

### 1. **Filesystem Basics**

* Learn how Linux organizes files: `/home`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/usr`, `/bin`, `/lib`.
* Practice:

  ```bash
  cd /etc
  ls -l
  pwd
  ```
* Resource:
  *Linux Journey → “Linux Fundamentals” → “Filesystem Structure”*

---

### 2. **Essential Commands**

* Learn the top 20 commands: `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `cat`, `less`, `grep`, `find`, `echo`, `which`, `man`.
* Practice moving, copying, searching files.
* Resource:
  *Ubuntu Pocket Guide → Chapter 2 “Core Commands”*

---

### 3. **Package Management (apt)**

* Installing, removing, updating software:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install tcpdump
  sudo apt remove tcpdump
  ```
* Resource:
  *LinuxCommand.org → “Package Management Basics”*

---

### 4. **Text Editing**

* Learn **nano** or **vim** just enough to edit files.
  Commands: `nano filename`, Ctrl+O (save), Ctrl+X (exit).

---

### 5. **System Info and Help**

* Learn to check system info:

  ```bash
  uname -a
  lsb_release -a
  df -h
  free -h
  top
  ```
* Using `man` and `--help` for any command:

  ```bash
  man grep
  grep --help
  ```

---

## **Day 2: Permissions, Networking, Processes, Troubleshooting**

### 1. **Users, Permissions, and sudo**

* Understand ownership and modes:

  ```bash
  ls -l
  chmod 755 script.sh
  chown user:user file
  ```
* Know the difference between root and normal user.

---

### 2. **Networking Basics**

* Find IP and interfaces:

  ```bash
  ip addr
  ping 8.8.8.8
  netstat -tulnp
  ```
* Know how to check connectivity and open ports.

---

### 3. **Processes and Logs**

* Kill or monitor processes:

  ```bash
  ps aux | grep program
  kill -9 PID
  ```
* View logs:

  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/syslog
  journalctl -xe
  ```

---

### 4. **Services (systemd)**

* Start, stop, check service status:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status ssh
  sudo systemctl restart ssh
  ```

---

### 5. **Troubleshooting Mindset**

* When a command fails:

  1. Check if the program is installed (`which program`).
  2. Check logs.
  3. Search `command error message site:askubuntu.com`.

---

## **How to Read Briefly but Effectively**

* Use **Ubuntu Pocket Guide and Reference** (skim for commands, copy examples).
* For each topic, **run every command on your VM** as you read—hands‑on is faster than memorizing.
* Use cheat sheets:
  Search for “Linux command cheat sheet PDF” → print or keep it on your desktop.

---

Do you want me to **create a single PDF cheat sheet** that compresses these 2 days of study into \~4 pages (with commands and quick explanations) so you can print or keep it open while practicing? Or should I **create a chapter‑by‑chapter study plan with exact free resources linked for each step**?
