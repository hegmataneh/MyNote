can pcap_compile input get ranje of port
{
Yes — `pcap_compile()` can take a filter expression that specifies a **range of ports**, because its input syntax is the same as the **tcpdump filter language** (BPF syntax).

For example:

* Single port:

```c
"tcp port 80"
```

* Multiple ports (OR):

```c
"tcp port 80 or tcp port 443"
```

* Range of ports:

```c
"tcp portrange 1000-2000"
```

So if you want to filter **all TCP packets with source or destination ports between 1000 and 2000**, you’d write:

```c
"tcp portrange 1000-2000"
```

Similarly for UDP:

```c
"udp portrange 5000-6000"
```

This works directly with `pcap_compile(handle, &fp, filter_exp, 0, net);`.

Do you want me to show you a **C example with `pcap_compile`** using a port range?
