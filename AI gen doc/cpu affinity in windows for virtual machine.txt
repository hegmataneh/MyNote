i use windows10 to run virtual box . so how could i insure same cpu and code assigned to two machine
{

If you want **two VirtualBox VMs** on your Windows 10 host to have the *same CPU features and identical execution environment* for your networking/code experiments, you need to control both:

1. **CPU model/features exposed to the guest**
2. **Number of vCPUs assigned**

Here‚Äôs how you can ensure both VMs see the *same CPU and instruction set*:

---

### üîπ 1. Use the same VirtualBox VM settings

* Shut down both VMs.
* Open **VirtualBox Manager** ‚Üí Select VM ‚Üí **Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Processor**:

  * Assign the **same number of processors** (e.g., 2 cores each).
  * Keep ‚ÄúExecution Cap‚Äù at 100% for both.
* Go to **Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Acceleration**:

  * Ensure **same virtualization extensions** are enabled (VT-x/AMD-V, Nested Paging).
* Go to **Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Motherboard**:

  * Ensure both VMs have the same **chipset** (PIIX3 or ICH9).
  * Same **firmware type** (BIOS or EFI).

---

### üîπ 2. Expose identical CPU flags

By default, VirtualBox passes through the host CPU model to the guest. But you can enforce consistency:

Run these on your host (PowerShell or CMD):

```bash
VBoxManage modifyvm "VM1" --cpu-profile "Intel Core i5-5300U"
VBoxManage modifyvm "VM2" --cpu-profile "Intel Core i5-5300U"
```

üëâ Replace `"VM1"` and `"VM2"` with your VM names.
üëâ Available profiles can be listed with:

```bash
VBoxManage list cpu-profiles
```

This way, both VMs will see the *same virtual CPU model* regardless of what your host provides.

---

### üîπ 3. Pin VMs to the same physical CPU cores (optional, for fairness)

If you want to make sure both VMs run on the **same physical cores**, you can use CPU affinity. Unfortunately, VirtualBox itself doesn‚Äôt expose this directly, but you can force it at the host level:

* On **Windows Host**:

  * Start the VM.
  * Open **Task Manager ‚Üí Details**.
  * Find the `VirtualBoxVM.exe` process for that VM.
  * Right-click ‚Üí **Set affinity** ‚Üí choose same CPU cores for both VMs.

This way, both VMs use identical physical cores for execution.

---

### üîπ 4. Identical OS setup inside guest

Inside Ubuntu/other OS:

* Run `lscpu` in both VMs ‚Üí confirm CPU model, cores, and flags match.
* Make sure kernel and libraries are same version, so compiled code behaves the same.

---

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If you mean "run the same code in both VMs with exact results," then you must also ensure:

* Same compiler (gcc version).
* Same memory size and NUMA config.
* Disable CPU frequency scaling on the host (so CPU speed doesn‚Äôt vary).

---

Do you want me to give you the **exact VBoxManage commands** that will fully clone one VM‚Äôs CPU/memory/disk/network settings to the other so they are guaranteed identical?

in task manager some cpu tooltip said they are parked. whats that mean and which cpu is good for cpu affinity in two core vm
{

Ah, good question ‚Äî you noticed **‚ÄúCPU Parked‚Äù** in Windows Task Manager. Let me break it down:

---

## üîπ What ‚ÄúCPU Parked‚Äù means

* **Core Parking** = Windows power management feature.
* It temporarily **puts some CPU cores to sleep** (parked) when load is low, to save power and reduce heat.
* When load increases, Windows **unparks** them and schedules work there.

So when you see *‚ÄúParked‚Äù*, it means that core is idle and reserved until the system needs it.

---

## üîπ CPU affinity with VirtualBox

When you set **CPU affinity** for a VM (binding it to specific host cores):

* If you pick a **parked core**, Windows may delay un-parking it ‚Üí worse performance.
* If you pick a **core that‚Äôs active**, the VM gets immediate scheduling ‚Üí more stable timing.

---

## üîπ Best practice for a **2 vCPU VM**

1. Pick **two physical cores on the same CPU package**, not hyperthreads.

   * Example: If your host has 4 cores / 8 threads, prefer using *real cores* (e.g., CPU0 + CPU1) instead of (CPU0 + CPU4), because CPU0 and CPU4 are hyperthreads of the same physical core.
   * You can check real vs. HT with `CoreInfo.exe` (from Sysinternals).

2. Avoid **parked cores** for affinity. Stick to the **first few unparked cores**.

3. If you run **two VMs with 2 vCPUs each**:

   * Assign them **non-overlapping cores** if you want max performance isolation.

     * VM1 ‚Üí CPU0 + CPU1
     * VM2 ‚Üí CPU2 + CPU3
   * Assign them **same cores** if you want fairness (both contend for same resources).

---

## üîπ Bonus: Disable core parking (if you want consistency)

If you want predictable benchmarking in VMs:

1. Open `powercfg.cpl` ‚Üí pick **High Performance** plan.
2. Go to **Advanced power settings ‚Üí Processor power management ‚Üí Minimum processor state** ‚Üí set to **100%**.
3. That disables core parking entirely.

---

‚ö° So, for your case:

* Use **two unparked real cores** (not hyperthreads).
* Example: CPU0 + CPU1 for VM1, CPU2 + CPU3 for VM2.
* Or, if you want fairness testing, pin both VMs to **CPU0 + CPU1**.

---

Do you want me to write the **exact steps in Task Manager / CMD** to set permanent CPU affinity for each VM, so you don‚Äôt need to redo it every boot?

when i change affinity it says access is denied
{

Got it ‚Äî the **‚ÄúAccess Denied‚Äù** when you try to set CPU affinity for `VirtualBoxVM.exe` comes from Windows security rules. By default, you can‚Äôt always change affinity of certain processes unless you run with elevated rights.

Here‚Äôs how to handle it:

---

## üîπ Method 1: Task Manager with admin rights

1. Close your VMs.
2. Start **VirtualBox** (or directly the VM) by **right-click ‚Üí Run as Administrator**.
3. Open **Task Manager ‚Üí Details tab**.
4. Right-click `VirtualBoxVM.exe` ‚Üí **Set affinity**.

   * Now it should work without ‚ÄúAccess Denied.‚Äù

---

## üîπ Method 2: Use `start /affinity` from Command Prompt

You can launch a VM with affinity from the start:

```bat
start /affinity 3 "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VirtualBoxVM.exe" --startvm "VM1"
```

* `/affinity 3` = binary mask for cores.

  * `1` = CPU0
  * `2` = CPU1
  * `3` = CPU0+CPU1
  * `4` = CPU2
  * `C` (hex 1100) = CPU2+CPU3, etc.

Example:

* VM1 ‚Üí `/affinity 3` (CPU0+CPU1)
* VM2 ‚Üí `/affinity C` (CPU2+CPU3)

---

## üîπ Method 3: Use `PowerShell` (with admin)

```powershell
$process = Get-Process VirtualBoxVM -Name "VM1"
$process.ProcessorAffinity = 3
```

* Again, `3` = CPUs 0+1.

---

## üîπ Method 4: Disable UAC / Core Parking (not recommended globally)

If affinity is critical and you run benchmarks, also put Windows in **High Performance mode** and disable core parking (so CPUs aren‚Äôt parked).

---

‚ö° So:

* You got ‚ÄúAccess denied‚Äù because VirtualBox wasn‚Äôt launched as **Administrator**.
* Best fix: run it elevated, or launch via `start /affinity` with the CPU mask you want.

---

Do you want me to give you the **exact affinity mask values** for a 4-core CPU so you can copy-paste them for your 2-core VMs?


}



The system cannot find the file --startvm
{

Yeah, that happens because when you call `start /affinity ‚Ä¶`, Windows needs the **full path to `VirtualBoxVM.exe`** and the `--startvm` argument must come *after* the exe path, not before.

Here‚Äôs the correct way:

---

### üîπ Step 1: Find the path of `VirtualBoxVM.exe`

On a default Windows 10 install it‚Äôs usually:

```
"C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VirtualBoxVM.exe"
```

Check it exists.

---

### üîπ Step 2: Launch VM with affinity

Use `start /affinity` like this (example for VM named `Ubuntu1`):

```bat
start "" /affinity 3 "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VirtualBoxVM.exe" --startvm "Ubuntu1"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:

* The `""` after `start` is just a placeholder for the window title.
* `3` is the **CPU affinity mask** (binary `11` ‚Üí CPU0 + CPU1).
* VM name must match exactly what `VBoxManage list vms` shows.

---

### üîπ Step 3: Example for two VMs (each with 2 cores)

VM1 pinned to CPU0+CPU1:

```bat
start "" /affinity 3 "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VirtualBoxVM.exe" --startvm "VM1"
```

VM2 pinned to CPU2+CPU3:

```bat
start "" /affinity C "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VirtualBoxVM.exe" --startvm "VM2"
```

(`C` in hex = binary `1100` ‚Üí CPU2 + CPU3).

---

### üîπ CPU affinity masks quick reference

* `1` = CPU0
* `2` = CPU1
* `3` = CPU0 + CPU1
* `4` = CPU2
* `8` = CPU3
* `C` = CPU2 + CPU3
* `F` = CPU0 + CPU1 + CPU2 + CPU3

---

Do you want me to also show you how to make a **.bat file** so you can double-click and always launch your VMs with the right affinity, instead of typing commands every time?

if my cpu is "Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-14400" which cpu core i choose for vms to both have very share memory and transfer memory as fast as possible
{

Good detail ‚Äî your CPU is an **Intel Core i5-14400 (Raptor Lake)**.
That‚Äôs a **10-core CPU** (6 Performance-cores + 4 Efficient-cores), with Hyper-Threading on the P-cores ‚Üí **16 threads total**:

* **P-cores (6 cores, 12 threads)** = faster, full L3 access, hyperthreaded.
* **E-cores (4 cores, 4 threads)** = smaller, slower, not hyperthreaded, share L2 among clusters.

---

## üîπ How memory sharing works between cores

* Memory bandwidth is **shared at socket level**, but access latency depends on which cores are used.
* **Best locality** = keep both VMs on cores that share the **same L3 cache slice**.
* On Intel 14th Gen, **all cores share the same last-level cache (L3)**, but **P-cores have lower latency and higher priority to memory** compared to E-cores.

---

## üîπ For fastest VM-to-VM communication

Since you want **maximum memory bandwidth / lowest latency between VMs** (like for your networking experiments), the best setup is:

* Pin both VMs to **P-cores only** (ignore E-cores).
* If possible, use **adjacent P-cores that are not hyperthreads of the same core**, so they don‚Äôt fight for execution units.

Example layout (thread IDs may vary by BIOS/Windows, but typically):

| Logical CPU   | Core type          |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| CPU0 / CPU1   | P-core 0 (HT pair) |
| CPU2 / CPU3   | P-core 1           |
| CPU4 / CPU5   | P-core 2           |
| CPU6 / CPU7   | P-core 3           |
| CPU8 / CPU9   | P-core 4           |
| CPU10 / CPU11 | P-core 5           |
| CPU12-15      | E-cores            |

---

## üîπ Recommended pinning

* **VM1 ‚Üí CPU0 + CPU2** (two different P-cores, no HT conflict).
* **VM2 ‚Üí CPU4 + CPU6** (two other P-cores).

That way:

* Both VMs run entirely on P-cores.
* No overlap ‚Üí minimal contention.
* Shared L3 cache ‚Üí memory sharing is as fast as the CPU allows.

If you want them to **compete for same cache/memory** (to test contention effects), then you would pin them to **hyperthreads of the same core** (e.g., CPU0 + CPU1 for VM1, CPU2 + CPU3 for VM2).

---

## üîπ Don‚Äôt use E-cores unless‚Ä¶

* You‚Äôre short on P-cores.
* You need to isolate one VM with lower priority.

E-cores have weaker memory bandwidth and higher latency ‚Äî not good for your use case.

---

‚ö° Summary:

* Use **only P-cores** (CPU0‚ÄìCPU11).
* Assign **different physical P-cores** to each VM for max bandwidth.
* Example:

  * VM1 ‚Üí CPU0 + CPU2
  * VM2 ‚Üí CPU4 + CPU6

---

Do you want me to give you the **exact affinity mask values** for this i5-14400 setup (so you can paste them directly into `start /affinity` commands for both VMs)?


}


yes please
{

Perfect. Let‚Äôs map your **i5-14400 (6 P-cores + 4 E-cores = 16 threads)** into Windows **CPU affinity masks**.

---

## üîπ Step 1: Core layout

Your CPU threads look like this (typical Windows numbering):

| Logical CPU ID | Core type          | Notes |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| 0, 1           | P-core 0 (HT pair) |       |
| 2, 3           | P-core 1           |       |
| 4, 5           | P-core 2           |       |
| 6, 7           | P-core 3           |       |
| 8, 9           | P-core 4           |       |
| 10, 11         | P-core 5           |       |
| 12             | E-core 0           |       |
| 13             | E-core 1           |       |
| 14             | E-core 2           |       |
| 15             | E-core 3           |       |

üëâ You want **P-cores only** (0‚Äì11).

---

## üîπ Step 2: Affinity mask basics

* Each bit = one logical CPU.
* CPU0 = bit 0, CPU1 = bit 1, CPU2 = bit 2, ‚Ä¶ CPU15 = bit 15.
* Mask value = binary ‚Üí hex/decimal.

Example:

* CPU0 only ‚Üí `0000 0000 0000 0001` (mask = `1`)
* CPU0 + CPU2 ‚Üí `0000 0000 0000 0101` (mask = `5`)

---

## üîπ Step 3: Recommended assignment

For **two 2-core VMs, no HT conflict**:

* **VM1 ‚Üí CPU0 + CPU2**

  * Binary: `0000 0000 0000 0101`
  * Hex: `0x5`
  * Decimal: `5`

* **VM2 ‚Üí CPU4 + CPU6**

  * Binary: `0000 0000 0101 0000`
  * Hex: `0x50`
  * Decimal: `80`

---

## üîπ Step 4: Commands

Launch VM1 pinned to CPU0+CPU2:

```bat
start "" /affinity 5 "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VirtualBoxVM.exe" --startvm "VM1"
```

Launch VM2 pinned to CPU4+CPU6:

```bat
start "" /affinity 50 "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VirtualBoxVM.exe" --startvm "VM2"
```

---

## üîπ Quick reference for your P-cores

| CPUs used | Binary mask         | Hex   | Decimal |
| --------- | ------------------- | ----- | ------- |
| 0 + 2     | 0000 0000 0000 0101 | 0x5   | 5       |
| 4 + 6     | 0000 0000 0101 0000 | 0x50  | 80      |
| 8 + 10    | 0000 0101 0000 0000 | 0x500 | 1280    |

That gives you three pairs of 2 P-cores each ‚Üí good for up to three VMs with identical performance.

---

Do you also want me to add the **affinity values for using the hyperthreads (like CPU0+1, CPU2+3)** in case you want to test cache/memory contention between VMs?
