i use tshark in ubuntu to get udp packet and count them. so it show 252 packets dropped from enp0s3. so why i can see this count with tools that use to list NIC stat like ip or netstat or ns
{

Good observation ‚Äî that ‚Äú**252 packets dropped from enp0s3**‚Äù in `tshark` doesn‚Äôt usually match what you see in `ip -s link`, `ethtool -S`, or `netstat -i`. The reason is that these drops are **not NIC-level drops** but **socket capture buffer drops**.

Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

---

### 1. Where tshark gets the "dropped" count

* `tshark` (via `libpcap`) asks the kernel to deliver packets from the NIC to a **capture ring buffer** in kernel memory.
* If packets arrive faster than `tshark` can pull them from that buffer into user space, the kernel increments a **‚Äúpacket dropped by capture‚Äù** counter.
* This drop counter is reported by `libpcap` as `X packets dropped`, and `tshark` shows it at the end of capture.

üëâ These are **drops in the capture path**, not physical NIC drops.

---

### 2. What `ip -s link` or `netstat` show

* `ip -s link show enp0s3` ‚Üí shows **interface-level statistics** (e.g., RX errors, RX dropped by NIC driver, buffer overflows at the driver level).
* `netstat -i` or `/proc/net/dev` ‚Üí same: they show packets dropped **before** reaching the OS networking stack.
* These counters only increase if the NIC/driver itself discards packets (e.g., ring buffer overflows at the NIC).

So if packets are dropped **inside the pcap capture buffer**, you won‚Äôt see them in `ip`, `netstat`, or `/proc/net/dev`.

---

### 3. Tools that can show pcap-level drops

* `tshark` / `tcpdump` ‚Üí already show dropped packets at capture.
* `cat /proc/net/packet` ‚Üí per-packet socket stats, including drops, for AF\_PACKET sockets (what pcap uses under Linux).
* `ss -s` (sometimes shows packet drops at socket level, but less detailed).

---

### 4. How to reduce capture drops

* Increase capture buffer size:

  ```bash
  tshark -B 4096 -i enp0s3
  ```

  (`-B` is in MB).
* Use `dumpcap` instead of `tshark`/`tcpdump` ‚Äî it‚Äôs more efficient (written for high-speed capture).
* Enable PF\_RING or AF\_PACKET v3 with mmap for faster zero-copy capture.
* Pin capture to a CPU core with `taskset`.
* Disable NIC offloads (GRO, LRO, TSO) when capturing raw packets:

  ```bash
  sudo ethtool -K enp0s3 gro off lro off tso off gso off
  ```

---

‚úÖ So the difference is:

* `ip`/`netstat` ‚Üí **NIC/driver-level drops**
* `tshark` ‚Üí **pcap buffer drops** (inside kernel, after NIC already handed packets to OS)

Do you want me to show you exactly how to check the `/proc/net/packet` drops so you can correlate with tshark‚Äôs numbers?

so how enable NIC offload to increase performance of NIC
{


Good ‚Äî let‚Äôs separate two things here because it‚Äôs easy to confuse them:

* **NIC offloads (TSO, GSO, GRO, LRO, checksum offload, etc.)**
  ‚Üí improve **network throughput/CPU usage** when the NIC is used normally (send/receive sockets, iperf, etc.).
  ‚Üí but they **distort or hide raw packets** when you are *capturing* with `tshark/tcpdump`, which is why packet capture guides recommend turning them **off**.

* **Packet capture (tshark/libpcap)**
  ‚Üí needs ‚Äúexact packets on the wire‚Äù. With offloads enabled, the kernel may merge packets (GRO/LRO) or hand giant segments (TSO/GSO), so capture won‚Äôt reflect real traffic.
  ‚Üí also, enabling offloads does **not** reduce capture drops, because the drop reason is the **pcap buffer filling**, not the NIC speed.

---

### 1. Check current NIC offload features

```bash
sudo ethtool -k enp0s3
```

You‚Äôll see things like:

```
tcp-segmentation-offload: on
generic-segmentation-offload: on
generic-receive-offload: on
large-receive-offload: off
rx-checksumming: on
tx-checksumming: on
```

---

### 2. Enable NIC offloads (for higher network performance)

If some are disabled and you want to turn them on (for **normal network use, not capture**):

```bash
sudo ethtool -K enp0s3 tso on gso on gro on lro on rx on tx on
```

---

### 3. When capturing with tshark/tcpdump

If your goal is **accurate packet capture**, you should *disable* them instead:

```bash
sudo ethtool -K enp0s3 gro off gso off tso off lro off
```

Because otherwise you might see fewer packets but larger ones (due to coalescing/segmentation).

---

### 4. Permanent change

`ethtool` settings reset on reboot. To make them permanent:

* On Ubuntu, add them in `/etc/network/interfaces` or better, with **systemd-networkd** or **netplan** using `ethtool` commands in `post-up` scripts.
  Example for Netplan (`/etc/netplan/*.yaml`):

```yaml
ethernets:
  enp0s3:
    dhcp4: true
    ethtool:
      offload:
        tso: true
        gso: true
        gro: true
```

---

‚úÖ Summary:

* Enable offloads = better NIC performance for general workloads.
* Disable offloads = better accuracy for packet capture (to avoid fake/merged packets).

Do you want higher **network throughput**, or higher **packet capture fidelity**? The answer changes whether we turn these on or off.
