Yes, the reason you see `http://ir.archive.ubuntu.com` is because Ubuntu detects your location (Iran) and assigns a mirror closest to you.

To **manually change** this mirror to use the **United States (US) servers**, follow these steps:

---

### ðŸ”§ Option 1: Edit sources.list (Manual Method)

1. Open the sources file with a text editor:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
   ```

2. Find all lines with:

   ```
   http://ir.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
   ```

   And replace them with:

   ```
   http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
   ```

3. If you see any lines like `security.ubuntu.com`, you can leave them, or also replace them with:

   ```
   http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
   ```

4. Save and exit:

   * Press `Ctrl + O` to write/save
   * Press `Enter` to confirm
   * Press `Ctrl + X` to exit

5. Update your package list:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

### ðŸ§° Option 2: Use `sed` to replace all at once

If you want a one-line command to automatically change all occurrences:

```bash
sudo sed -i 's|http://ir.archive.ubuntu.com|http://us.archive.ubuntu.com|g' /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt update
```

Let me know if you're using a different file like `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/*` or if the change doesnâ€™t take effect.
