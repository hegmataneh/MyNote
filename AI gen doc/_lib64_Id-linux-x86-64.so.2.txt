whats that visual studio says loading symbols for for module /lib64/Id-linux-x86-64.so.2. and how to cancel it or fix it to no bother me anymore
{
Excellent—let’s clarify what you’re seeing and how to disable it.

When you see:

> *Loading symbols for module /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2* (note your typo: you wrote `Id` instead of `ld`)

It’s Visual Studio’s debugger downloading *symbol* information for that module. Symbols are the “debug info” (like function names and source line mappings) so you can step into or see stack frames *inside* those system libraries.

For system libraries like `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` (the dynamic linker itself), you usually **don’t care** about symbols unless you're debugging glibc itself.

Visual Studio (especially when debugging remotely on Linux) can try to get symbols for all loaded modules. This is slow and noisy.

## Why does it happen?

When your program loads, the debugger:

1. Enumerates all loaded shared objects (`.so` files).
2. Tries to load debugging symbols for them.
3. Downloads them (from the remote Linux machine to your Windows) if using remote debugging.

This can cause “Loading symbols for...” spam in the output window or status bar.

## How to disable or reduce it in Visual Studio

Here are the main ways to stop it:

---

### 1️⃣ Turn off automatic symbol loading for all modules except yours

This is the usual approach.

1. Go to **Tools** > **Options**.
2. Expand **Debugging** > **Symbols**.
3. Uncheck **Load all modules, unless excluded**.
4. (Optional) Add exclusions or inclusions:

   * Add your project's .so/.exe as an explicit inclusion.
   * Exclude system paths if needed.

Now Visual Studio won't load symbols for system libraries.

---

### 2️⃣ Disable Microsoft Symbol Servers

If it's pulling symbols from online:

1. Same **Tools** > **Options** > **Debugging** > **Symbols**.
2. Uncheck **Microsoft Symbol Servers**.

This stops attempts to fetch Microsoft symbols (less relevant for Linux, but can reduce clutter).

---

### 3️⃣ Control Symbol Loading in Debug Session

While debugging:

* Open the **Modules** window (Debug > Windows > Modules).
* Right-click the module (e.g. `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`).
* Choose **Symbol Load Information** or **Load Symbols**.
* You can set it to **Never load symbols for this module**.

---

### 4️⃣ Use Symbol Cache

If you still want some symbols (like your own app), set up a **local cache**:

* Still in **Tools** > **Options** > **Debugging** > **Symbols**.
* Add a local folder as your cache.
* This reduces repeated downloading.

---

### 5️⃣ For Remote Linux Debugging

If you're using the **Linux Workload**:

* Visual Studio sometimes copies symbols from the Linux box.
* You can set **project properties** > **Debugging** > **Enable Symbol Loading** to **False** (this option depends on your VS version).

---

## TL;DR

✅ Go to *Tools > Options > Debugging > Symbols*.
✅ Uncheck *Load all modules, unless excluded*.
✅ Add your own binaries if needed.

That will stop the annoying *Loading symbols for /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2* messages.

If you tell me your **Visual Studio version** (e.g. 2022, 2019) and whether you're debugging:

* Native C++?
* Managed .NET?
* Remote Linux?

—I can give you *even more specific steps*.
