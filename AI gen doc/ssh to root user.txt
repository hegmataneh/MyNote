in ubuntu get me list of users
{
	In Ubuntu, you can list all users in several ways. The most common is to read the `/etc/passwd` file, which stores user account information.

	**Command:**

	```bash
	cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
	```

	This will print just the usernames.

	If you also want to see details such as UID, home directory, and shell:

	```bash
	cat /etc/passwd
	```

	For **only human users** (with UID ≥ 1000 and not system accounts), you can filter:

	```bash
	awk -F: '$3 >= 1000 {print $1}' /etc/passwd
	```

	Do you want me to also show you **their privilege level** so you can see which ones have `sudo` access?

}

check if user has privilage to do root things
{
	In Ubuntu, the usual way to check if a user has root privileges is to see if they are in the **`sudo`** group (or `admin` on older releases).

	**To check a specific user:**

	```bash
	groups username
	```

	If `sudo` appears in the list, that user can run commands with `sudo` (root privileges).

	**Example:**

	```bash
	groups mohsen
	# output might be: mohsen : mohsen sudo
	```

	**To list all users with sudo privileges:**

	```bash
	getent group sudo
	```

	This shows the group name, group ID, and all members.

	**Alternative check (direct sudoers file scan):**

	```bash
	sudo grep -E '^%sudo|username' /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/* 2>/dev/null
	```

	If you want, I can give you a **single command** that lists **only users who can do root things**.
	Do you want me to prepare that?

}

what is default password for root user
{
	On Ubuntu, the **root account has no default password** — by design it’s **locked** for security reasons.

	* You **cannot log in directly as root** by default.
	* Instead, Ubuntu expects you to use your own user account with `sudo` for administrative tasks.

	If you try:

	```bash
	su -
	```

	You’ll get:

	```
	su: Authentication failure
	```

	because there’s no usable root password.

	If you want to set a root password (enabling `su` login as root):

	```bash
	sudo passwd root
	```

	It will prompt you to enter and confirm a new password for the root account.

	Do you want me to also show you **how to temporarily enable root login** without permanently setting a password?

}

is that possible to ssh with root user to server. and how can make it possible
{
	Yes — you can SSH directly as `root` to a server, but in **Ubuntu** it’s disabled by default for security reasons.
	You have to **enable it in the SSH server configuration** and make sure the root account has a password or key set.

	### **Steps to allow SSH login as root in Ubuntu**

	1. **Set a password for root (if not set)**

	   ```bash
	   sudo passwd root
	   ```

	   Enter a strong password.

	---

	2. **Edit the SSH configuration**

	   ```bash
	   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	   ```

	   Find and change:

	   ```
	   PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
	   ```

	   to:

	   ```
	   PermitRootLogin yes
	   ```

	   *(You can also use `without-password` to only allow key-based login.)*

	---

	3. **Restart SSH service**

	   ```bash
	   sudo systemctl restart ssh
	   ```

	---

	4. **SSH as root from client**

	   ```bash
	   ssh root@server_ip
	   ```

	---

	**⚠ Security note:**
	Direct root SSH login is a major security risk — it’s safer to use:

	* Key-based authentication (`PermitRootLogin without-password`)
	* Or login as a normal user, then `sudo` for root actions.

	---

	If you want, I can give you a **configuration that only allows root login with an SSH key** and blocks password logins, which is much safer.
	Do you want that version?
