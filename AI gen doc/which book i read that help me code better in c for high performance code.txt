which book i read that help me code better in c for high performance code
{

For **high-performance C programming**, you’ll want books that go beyond syntax and teach you how the CPU, memory, and compiler work — so you can write code that uses caches efficiently, avoids bottlenecks, and exploits modern CPU features.

Here’s a curated list (practical → deep theory):

---

## 1. **Practical Performance-Oriented C**

These are best starting points if you want hands-on improvement quickly.

* **Modern C** – Jens Gustedt
  *Focus:* Correct, modern, and portable C (C11/C17). Strong foundation to avoid UB (undefined behavior) that kills performance.
  Good before you start tuning for speed.

* **21st Century C** – Ben Klemens
  *Focus:* Practical build systems, testing, libraries, and modern style — helps you write maintainable yet fast C.

---

## 2. **CPU Architecture & Memory Awareness**

Performance is mostly about understanding **how CPUs fetch data**.

* **Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective (CS\:APP)** – Bryant & O’Hallaron
  *Focus:* Caching, memory hierarchy, and how code is executed.
  Has great sections on **cache-friendly coding** and **performance measurement**.

* **Programming from the Ground Up** – Jonathan Bartlett (free PDF)
  *Focus:* Assembly-level thinking for C programmers — you learn what compiler generates, useful for tuning.

---

## 3. **Algorithmic & Low-Level Optimization**

Once you know the architecture, move to algorithm design and micro-optimizations.

* **Algorithms in C** – Robert Sedgewick
  *Focus:* Data structures and algorithms that are cache-aware and practical.

* **Optimizing C in the Real World** – Agner Fog (free online)
  *Focus:* Instruction-level optimization, CPU pipelines, vectorization.
  Agner Fog’s optimization manuals are legendary for understanding **what compilers actually do**.

---

## 4. **Serious Performance Tuning**

If you want to squeeze every cycle from hardware:

* **Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface** – David A. Patterson & John L. Hennessy
  *Focus:* Deep hardware-level details, teaches you to write code that maps well to microarchitecture.

* **High Performance Computing** – Charles Severance
  *Focus:* Parallel programming, memory bandwidth, cache coherence, NUMA-aware design.

---

## 5. **Profiling and Tools**

Books are good, but practice matters. Learn to use:

* **perf** (Linux performance profiler)
* **valgrind / cachegrind**
* **gprof**
* **clang/gcc -O3 -march=native -S** (inspect assembly)

---

### Recommended Learning Order

1. **Modern C** → solid, clean codebase.
2. **CS\:APP** → understand CPU, memory, cache, and what kills performance.
3. **Agner Fog manuals** + practice using `perf` → learn to optimize real hot loops.

---

Do you want me to prepare you a **progressive reading + practice plan** (with small coding exercises) so you can improve step-by-step instead of reading everything at once? That would give you a structured roadmap.
