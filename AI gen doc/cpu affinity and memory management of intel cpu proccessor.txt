whats your recommendation for me to read that get me knowledge about cpu affinity and memory management of intel cpu proccessor that help me knoledge i should know about this mechanism

Alright — you want to build **solid knowledge** about CPU affinity and Intel memory/cache behavior. That’s a good path, because this is exactly the stuff that affects how your VMs talk to memory and share performance.

Here’s how I’d structure your learning, from practical → deep technical:

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Practical OS-level affinity

* **Windows Internals** (by Mark Russinovich, Microsoft Press) → chapters on **scheduling, affinity, NUMA**.
* **Sysinternals tools**:

  * [`Coreinfo`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/coreinfo) → shows you how Windows numbers cores, hyperthreads, caches.
  * [`Process Explorer`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) → lets you experiment with affinity + observe.

This gives you the OS perspective: *what affinity means, how threads are mapped*.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: CPU architecture basics

* **Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual**
  👉 This is the “bible” for Intel CPUs. Explains caches (L1/L2/L3), memory bandwidth, hyperthreading, NUMA.
  Download: [Intel manual](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html)
  → Focus on chapters:

  * Memory hierarchy
  * Cache sharing between hyperthreads
  * Core affinity and scheduling

* **Agner Fog’s microarchitecture guides**
  👉 Independent researcher, amazing detail but still readable.
  [Agner Fog’s guides](https://www.agner.org/optimize/)

  * “Microarchitecture” PDF → how Intel CPUs actually execute, caches, pipelines.
  * “Optimizing software in C++” → how to write/test code that respects affinity, cache, bandwidth.

---

## 🔹 Step 3: NUMA and memory locality

Even though your i5-14400 is **single-socket (no NUMA)**, concepts carry over.

* **“What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory”** (Ulrich Drepper, Red Hat)
  👉 Classic paper explaining caches, memory latency, and affinity effects.
  [PDF link](https://akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf)

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Benchmark + hands-on

* Learn by measuring. Use Linux tools inside your VM:

  * `lscpu` → check affinity and topology.
  * `taskset` → pin processes (like you tried in Windows).
  * `numactl --hardware` → see memory/NUMA layout.
  * `perf stat -e cache-misses,cache-references` → see cache effects when pinning.

This way, you **see the theory in action**.

---

## 🔹 Step 5: If you want to go even deeper

* **Intel VTune Profiler** (free for students/devs) → shows thread affinity, cache usage, memory bandwidth.
* **Academic books**:

  * *Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach* (Hennessy & Patterson) → very deep, but gold standard.
  * *Systems Performance* (Brendan Gregg) → more practical, explains CPU scheduling, affinity, cache.

---

⚡ My **recommended reading order for you** (to balance time vs depth):

1. Drepper’s *What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory* (fast + foundational).
2. Agner Fog’s *Microarchitecture guide* (how Intel cores/cache really behave).
3. Intel Optimization Manual (reference for advanced tuning).
4. Windows Internals (if you want to see how Windows scheduler + affinity works under the hood).

---

Do you want me to make you a **mini learning roadmap with exercises** (e.g., first run `taskset` on Linux, then measure cache misses, then compare hyperthread vs physical core affinity) so you don’t just read but actually *see* how affinity and memory management work?
