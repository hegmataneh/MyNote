please tell me most important thing aroung linux net.core.rmem_max
{
	The most important thing about **`net.core.rmem_max`** in Linux is:

	It **sets the maximum size (in bytes) of the receive socket buffer** that applications can request via `SO_RCVBUF` (with `setsockopt()`), but it does **not** directly set the buffer size of all sockets — it only defines an *upper limit*.

	---

	### Key points you should know:

	1. **Purpose**

	   * Controls the **upper bound** for the receive buffer size of any socket.
	   * Affects TCP, UDP, and raw sockets.

	2. **Default behavior**

	   * The default value is often **212992 bytes** (around 208 KB) on many distros.
	   * Applications can request smaller buffers, but not bigger than this value unless this sysctl is increased.

	3. **Relation to `net.core.rmem_default`**

	   * `net.core.rmem_default` sets the default receive buffer size for new sockets.
	   * `net.core.rmem_max` only limits the *maximum* allowed when an application explicitly requests more.

	4. **UDP & packet loss**

	   * For **high-throughput UDP applications**, a small `rmem_max` can cause packet drops if incoming packets fill the buffer faster than the app can read them.
	   * Increasing it allows larger `SO_RCVBUF` to be set, which can hold more packets before overflow.

	5. **Changing the value**

	   * Temporary (until reboot):

		 ```bash
		 sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=26214400
		 ```
	   * Permanent: add to `/etc/sysctl.conf` or a file in `/etc/sysctl.d/`:

		 ```
		 net.core.rmem_max = 26214400
		 ```

		 Then:

		 ```bash
		 sudo sysctl -p
		 ```

	6. **Application-level setting still required**

	   * Even if you increase `net.core.rmem_max`, applications **must** call:

		 ```c
		 setsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUF, &size, sizeof(size));
		 ```

		 to actually use a larger buffer.
	   * Kernel doubles the requested value internally for bookkeeping (so request `2×` the desired size).

	---

	If you want, I can give you a **practical example** of tuning `net.core.rmem_max` for high-speed UDP capture so you avoid packet loss.
	Do you want me to prepare that?
