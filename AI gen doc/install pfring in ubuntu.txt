to install pf_ring it must be vpn in ubuntu linux



Good point ‚Äî you're right. **PF\_RING** is a high-performance Linux packet capture framework that **should** be on the list. Here's why it‚Äôs important and how it compares to the other stacks:

---

## üîπ **PF\_RING**

* **Website**: [https://www.ntop.org/products/packet-capture/pf\_ring/](https://www.ntop.org/products/packet-capture/pf_ring/)
* **Developed by**: [ntop](https://www.ntop.org)
* **Type**: Kernel module + user-space API
* **Use case**: High-speed packet capture and analysis with or without kernel bypass.
* **Ubuntu support**: Actively tested on Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, 22.04 (DEB packages available).

---

### ‚úÖ Features

* **High-performance packet capture**: Much faster than raw `libpcap`.
* **Zero-copy mode**: Via `PF_RING ZC` (requires compatible NICs).
* **Compatible with libpcap**: Tools like `tcpdump`, `Wireshark`, `nprobe`, and `ntopng` can benefit with minimal change.
* **Multi-threaded**: Works efficiently on multicore CPUs.
* **Supports NIC drivers**: Like Intel iXGBE, i40e with custom ZC drivers.

### üîÑ PF\_RING vs Others:

| Feature              | PF\_RING            | DPDK           | XDP + AF\_XDP     | Netmap   | VPP  |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | -------- | ---- |
| Kernel bypass        | Partial (ZC mode)   | Yes            | Partial           | Yes      | Yes  |
| POSIX socket API     | Yes (libpcap-like)  | No             | No                | Limited  | No   |
| Complexity           | Low‚ÄìMedium          | High           | Medium            | Medium   | High |
| Packet capture speed | Very high (ZC mode) | Extremely high | Very high         | High     | High |
| Ubuntu support       | Excellent           | Excellent      | Excellent         | Moderate | Good |

### üîß When to Use PF\_RING

Use PF\_RING when:

* You want **high-speed packet capture** but **stay close to libpcap** tools.
* You need to **accelerate existing tools** like `tcpdump`, `nprobe`, `ntopng`, or `Suricata`.
* You want **low setup complexity** but **high performance**.

---

### ‚ùó Notes

* **PF\_RING ZC** (Zero Copy) is **not open-source** ‚Äî requires commercial license for full features.
* Regular PF\_RING (open-source) is fast, but **not kernel bypass** unless using ZC.
* Excellent for users who want **performance boost** without rewriting apps.

### üß™ Ubuntu Installation Quick Reference

```bash
# Add ntop repository (change based on Ubuntu version)
wget https://packages.ntop.org/apt/ntop.key
sudo apt-key add ntop.key
echo "deb http://packages.ntop.org/apt/$(lsb_release -cs)/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ntop.list
sudo apt update

# Install PF_RING
sudo apt install pfring

# Check if working
modinfo pf_ring
```

Let me know if you want examples with `tcpdump`, `libpcap`, or ZC API for PF\_RING.
