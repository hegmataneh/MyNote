i have virtual machine that there is ubuntu resident in it. so i want this os pass every udp and tcp packet to host computer ip that it is windows with ip 192.168.100.6 and port 4444 and in windows every packet with port 4444 pass to 127.0.0.1:51889 that it is my psiphon tunnel port. and i want my for example in my ubuntu tell sudo sudo apt update. and it is update by tunnel that windows provided. can you help me  step by step to do this.
{
To achieve this setup, you're essentially trying to **redirect all Ubuntu network traffic through a tunnel that is on your Windows host**, by sending packets from Ubuntu to your host (192.168.100.6:4444), and then having the host forward those to the Psiphon local SOCKS or HTTP proxy on 127.0.0.1:51889.

---

## üß≠ Goal Overview

### Ubuntu VM ‚Üí Windows Host ‚Üí Psiphon (on Windows)

You want to:

* Forward **all TCP/UDP traffic** from Ubuntu to `192.168.100.6:4444` (Windows).
* On **Windows**, forward everything received on port `4444` to local `127.0.0.1:51889` (Psiphon).
* Make `apt update` and other commands on Ubuntu go through Psiphon.

---

## üß± Step-by-Step Guide

### ‚úÖ STEP 1: Confirm Psiphon is running on Windows

1. Run **Psiphon3**.
2. In the settings, ensure **"Enable local proxy"** is checked.
3. Confirm:

   * **SOCKS Proxy** is on `127.0.0.1:1080`
   * **HTTP Proxy** is on `127.0.0.1:51889`
     (adjust below if yours is different)

You need **one of these proxies open**. If it's port `51889` as you mentioned, we use that.

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 2: Setup port forwarding on Windows (port 4444 ‚Üí 127.0.0.1:51889)

You can use **`netsh`** or **a tool like `rinetd` for Windows**, but the easiest reliable method is `rinetd`:

#### üîß Option A: Use `rinetd` on Windows

1. Download Windows version of `rinetd`:
   [https://sourceforge.net/projects/rinetd/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rinetd/)

2. Edit `rinetd.conf`:

   ```txt
   0.0.0.0 4444 127.0.0.1 51889
   ```

3. Run `rinetd.exe` in an Administrator command prompt.

   > Now any packets sent to Windows on port `4444` will be forwarded to Psiphon tunnel.

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 3: Configure Ubuntu to forward all traffic to Windows

You want to **redirect all traffic through a proxy**, not raw TCP/UDP. Since Psiphon gives an **HTTP or SOCKS proxy**, you can‚Äôt just ‚Äúforward TCP/UDP‚Äù unless you **wrap all traffic in a proxy-aware application**.

There are two ways:

---

### üöÄ Option 1 (Recommended): Use `redsocks` or `tun2socks` on Ubuntu

#### üîπ1. Install dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redsocks iptables -y
```

#### üîπ2. Create a redsocks config file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/redsocks.conf
```

Paste:

```ini
base {
 log_debug = on;
 log_info = on;
 daemon = on;
 redirector = iptables;
}

redsocks {
 local_ip = 127.0.0.1;
 local_port = 12345;

 ip = 192.168.100.6;
 port = 4444;

 type = http-relay;
}
```

> We will redirect traffic to this local `12345`, and it will send to `192.168.100.6:4444`, which Windows forwards to Psiphon.

#### üîπ3. Start redsocks:

```bash
sudo redsocks -c /etc/redsocks.conf
```

#### üîπ4. Redirect traffic to redsocks using iptables:

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -N REDSOCKS

# Bypass local addresses
sudo iptables -t nat -A REDSOCKS -d 0.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN
sudo iptables -t nat -A REDSOCKS -d 127.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN
sudo iptables -t nat -A REDSOCKS -d 192.168.0.0/16 -j RETURN
sudo iptables -t nat -A REDSOCKS -d 10.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN
sudo iptables -t nat -A REDSOCKS -d 172.16.0.0/12 -j RETURN

# Redirect everything else
sudo iptables -t nat -A REDSOCKS -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345

# Apply to OUTPUT
sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -j REDSOCKS
```

> Now any **outgoing TCP request** (like `apt update`) will go through Psiphon.

---

### üîÅ (Optional) Make it persistent

If you want these iptables rules to survive reboot, you can save them:

```bash
sudo apt install iptables-persistent
sudo netfilter-persistent save
```

---

### üîé STEP 4: Test it

Now try this in Ubuntu:

```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```

You should see the **IP address from Psiphon** network, not your actual one.

Try:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

If successful, you're tunneling through Psiphon.

---

## ‚ùó UDP is not supported directly

Psiphon only works for **TCP traffic** (because it uses HTTP/SOCKS), so **UDP** traffic like DNS or some games won't be tunneled. But you can redirect DNS over TCP or use a proxy-aware DNS client (like `dnscrypt-proxy` or `dns2tcp`).

| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |

Let me know if you want to tunnel UDP via SOCKS5 too (using `tun2socks` or VPN routing), or if you want a script to automate all this.

please help port forward with netsh also
{
To forward TCP traffic on **Windows** from port `4444` to `127.0.0.1:51889` (your Psiphon HTTP proxy), using the built-in `netsh` tool, follow these steps:

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Use `netsh` for Port Forwarding (Windows)

### üîß 1. Enable PortProxy Service (if not already running)

Open **Command Prompt as Administrator** and run:

```cmd
sc config iphlpsvc start= auto
net start iphlpsvc
```

---

### üîß 2. Add Port Forwarding Rule

Run this command in **Administrator Command Prompt**:

```cmd
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=4444 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=51889 connectaddress=127.0.0.1
```

‚úÖ This forwards:

* Traffic from `0.0.0.0:4444` (i.e. from Ubuntu to Windows IP `192.168.100.6:4444`)
* To local Psiphon proxy at `127.0.0.1:51889`

---

### üîç 3. View Current Portproxy Rules

To confirm the rule was added:

```cmd
netsh interface portproxy show all
```

You should see:

```
Listen on ipv4:             Connect to ipv4:
  Address         Port      Address         Port
  -------------   -----     -------------   -----
  0.0.0.0         4444      127.0.0.1       51889
```

---

### üß™ 4. Test From Ubuntu

From your **Ubuntu VM**, send TCP packets to:

```
192.168.100.6:4444
```

They should be **relayed by Windows to `127.0.0.1:51889`**, and handled by Psiphon.

You can test:

```bash
curl -x http://192.168.100.6:4444 http://ifconfig.me
```

If working, this will show your **Psiphon IP**.

---

### üßπ 5. Remove the Rule (if needed)

To delete the forwarding rule:

```cmd
netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenport=4444 listenaddress=0.0.0.0
```

---

### ‚ö† Important Notes

* `netsh` only works for **TCP**, not UDP.
* Windows firewall may block inbound traffic. Make sure port `4444` is allowed through the firewall:

  Go to:

  * **Windows Defender Firewall** > **Advanced Settings** > **Inbound Rules**
  * Add a rule to allow TCP port `4444`

---

Let me know if you want to test the port or need a way to forward **UDP traffic or DNS**.

}


it says "err redsocks.c:1390 redsocks_init_instance(...) bind: Address already in use" 
{

The error:

```
err redsocks.c:1390 redsocks_init_instance(...) bind: Address already in use
```

means that **redsocks is trying to bind to a local IP and port that is already in use by another process**.

---

## üîç Step-by-Step to Fix

### ‚úÖ 1. Check what is using the port (likely `12345` on `127.0.0.1`)

Run this on your Ubuntu VM:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :12345
```

or

```bash
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 12345
```

You will see output like:

```
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:12345     0.0.0.0:*       LISTEN      1234/someprogram
```

That means another program (like another redsocks instance, or some service) is already using the port.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Kill the conflicting process (if you want)

If it's safe to stop that process:

```bash
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

Replace `<PID>` with the number shown in the `netstat` or `lsof` output.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Change redsocks port (if you don‚Äôt want to kill the other process)

Edit your `/etc/redsocks.conf`:

Change this section:

```ini
local_port = 12345;
```

to something unused, e.g.:

```ini
local_port = 12346;
```

Then **update your iptables redirect rule** to match:

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -R REDSOCKS 6 -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12346
```

> Or delete and re-add the rule with new port:

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -D REDSOCKS -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345
sudo iptables -t nat -A REDSOCKS -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12346
```

Then start redsocks again:

```bash
sudo redsocks -c /etc/redsocks.conf
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Check if it's working

Now check if redsocks is listening:

```bash
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep redsocks
```

You should see it listening on `127.0.0.1:12346` or your new port.

---

Let me know if you want to automate it with a script or systemd service.
