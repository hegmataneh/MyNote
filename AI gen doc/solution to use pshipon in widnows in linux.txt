in windows 10 i run psiphon3 to change my ip or setup vpn. so i want to see how this app use to tunnel my connection and bypass filtering in my country

To understand how **Psiphon3** works on Windows 10 and tunnels your traffic to bypass filtering, here's a breakdown of its internal behavior and tunneling method:

---

## üîç Overview: How Psiphon3 Works

Psiphon is a **censorship circumvention tool** that combines multiple techniques:

* **VPN (L2TP over IPsec, OpenVPN)**
* **SSH Tunnel with obfuscation**
* **HTTP Proxy**
* **WebSocket tunneling (obfuscated SSH)**
* **Domain fronting (via CDN like CloudFront, Azure, etc.)**

Psiphon3 on Windows acts **like a local proxy server** and routes some or all of your traffic through **encrypted tunnels** to servers outside your country.

---

## üß† How It Tunnels Your Traffic

When you start Psiphon3:

1. **Starts a local HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS proxy server** on your machine (usually at `127.0.0.1:8080` or similar).
2. **Establishes a tunnel (SSH or VPN)** to a Psiphon server located in a free country.
3. Your apps (or system browser) are **configured to send requests to the local proxy**.
4. Psiphon **forwards these requests securely** through the encrypted tunnel.

## üîß Confirm Proxy Ports

After launching Psiphon3, check which ports are active:

```cmd
netstat -an | findstr LISTENING
```

Look for something like:

```
TCP    127.0.0.1:8080   LISTENING
TCP    127.0.0.1:1080   LISTENING
```

* Port `8080` = HTTP proxy
* Port `1080` = SOCKS5 proxy

---

## üß™ Analyze Psiphon's Tunnel (Step-by-Step)

### 1. üî¨ See Connections Made by Psiphon

Use this command in PowerShell or CMD:

```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr psiphon3.exe
```

Then see what remote IPs it connects to (those are Psiphon servers, often obfuscated domains).

---

### 2. üß∞ Use Wireshark to Capture Psiphon Traffic

* Start Wireshark
* Filter: `tcp.port == 443` (to capture HTTPS traffic)
* Look for connections to **Psiphon server IPs**
* Traffic is **encrypted**, but you can see:

  * Remote IPs
  * TLS handshake
  * Obfuscation headers

---

### 3. üõ† Use Proxifier to See Routed Apps

Install [Proxifier](https://www.proxifier.com/) to:

* See which applications are using Psiphon's proxy
* Force all apps (even ones without proxy settings) to go through Psiphon

---

## üì¶ Optional: See Config File or Launch Info

Psiphon3 stores some logs/config here:

```
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Psiphon3\
```

Check files like `psiphon3.log` for:

* Proxy port setup
* Server IP used
* Connection mode: SSH+, VPN, etc.

## üß≠ Summary

| Feature          | Behavior in Psiphon3                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Proxy method     | Local HTTP/SOCKS proxy                  |
| Tunnel type      | SSH with obfuscation / VPN              |
| Obfuscation      | Anti-DPI headers, domain fronting       |
| Port use         | 1080 (SOCKS), 8080 (HTTP)               |
| Data encryption  | Yes (SSH or TLS)                        |
| Whole-system VPN | No (on Windows, it's per-app via proxy) |

---

If you want to **route Linux or VirtualBox traffic** through Psiphon3 running on the **Windows host**, I can also guide you through setting up **iptables/ipchains** or **proxychains** to use the Psiphon local proxy (`127.0.0.1:1080`) on the guest.

Would you like help with that too?
