i have file in my windows and i can ping some machine in network . how can send file into that machine that i can ssh into it
{
Nice — since you can SSH into the machine, the easiest and most reliable ways are `scp`/SFTP (secure copy over SSH) or a GUI SFTP client. Below I give several practical options (command examples + quick troubleshooting). Pick whichever matches your setup.

# Quick checklist (before copying)

1. You can SSH: `ssh user@REMOTE_IP` (if that works, file copy will work).
2. Know the SSH port (default `22`). If non-standard, note it (e.g. `2222`).
3. Know the remote path where you want the file (e.g. `/home/user/` or `C:\Users\user\` if remote is Windows with SSH).
4. If Windows firewall blocks outgoing or remote blocks incoming, copy will fail — see troubleshooting below.

---

# 1) Recommended: `scp` (command line)

Windows 10/11 usually has OpenSSH client. From PowerShell or CMD:

Copy single file:

```
scp C:\path\to\myfile.txt user@192.168.1.5:/home/user/
```

If remote uses a different port (e.g. 2222):

```
scp -P 2222 C:\path\to\myfile.txt user@192.168.1.5:/home/user/
```

Copy a directory recursively:

```
scp -r C:\path\to\myfolder user@192.168.1.5:/home/user/
```

If you use WSL, you can run the usual Linux `scp` from inside WSL:

```
scp /mnt/c/Users/you/file.txt user@192.168.1.5:/home/user/
```

---

# 2) If you use PuTTY tools: `pscp`

If you installed PuTTY, use `pscp.exe` from Command Prompt (or add it to PATH):

```
pscp C:\path\to\myfile.txt user@192.168.1.5:/home/user/
pscp -P 2222 C:\path\to\myfile.txt user@192.168.1.5:/home/user/
```

---

# 3) GUI: WinSCP (easy, drag & drop)

1. Install WinSCP.
2. New session → Protocol: SFTP (or SCP), Host name = `192.168.1.5`, Username, Port.
3. Login and drag your file from left (local) to right (remote).
   Good if you prefer visual file transfers.

---

# 4) FileZilla (SFTP) — GUI alternative

Use FileZilla Client, choose SFTP, connect and transfer via drag & drop.

---

# 5) `rsync` over SSH (for large/partial/efficient sync)

If you need resume/delta transfers, use `rsync` from WSL or Cygwin:

```
rsync -avP /mnt/c/Users/you/largefile user@192.168.1.5:/home/user/
```

`-P` shows progress and allows resume.

---

# 6) If `scp`/SFTP are not available: pipe over `ssh`

You can upload using a raw SSH pipe (works even if no scp client):
From PowerShell/CMD:

```
type C:\path\to\myfile.txt | ssh user@192.168.1.5 "cat > /home/user/myfile.txt"
```

Or in PowerShell:

```
Get-Content C:\path\to\myfile.txt -Raw | ssh user@192.168.1.5 "cat > /home/user/myfile.txt"
```

(Useful trick when limited tools are installed.)

---

# Troubleshooting

* If `scp` hangs or fails: test SSH first: `ssh user@192.168.1.5` — if login works, copying should.
* If non-standard port: use `-P` (scp/pscp) or `-p` (rsync uses `-e "ssh -p PORT"`). Example:

  ```
  scp -P 2222 file user@host:/path/
  ```
* If permission denied on remote, check target directory permissions or use a directory you own (`/home/user/` or `/tmp/`).
* To test port from Windows PowerShell:

  ```
  Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 192.168.1.5 -Port 22
  ```
* If remote is Windows and has SMB share enabled, you can also copy via UNC path: `\\REMOTE_IP\share` (but only if that share exists).

---

# Example full session

Assume local file `C:\Users\me\report.txt`, remote user `root`, remote IP `192.168.1.5`, remote folder `/root/`:

```
scp C:\Users\me\report.txt root@192.168.1.5:/root/
# enter password when prompted
```

---

If you tell me:

* the Windows path of the file,
* the remote username and IP (or hostname), and
* whether SSH runs on a nonstandard port —
  I can give the exact command line to paste.

how about transfer from ubuntu to ubuntu
{
Good — between two **Ubuntu machines**, it’s even simpler since both already have OpenSSH and `scp`/`rsync` available by default.

Here are the standard and most practical ways:

---

## 🧩 Option 1 — `scp` (secure copy)

Copy file:

```bash
scp /path/to/local/file.txt user@192.168.1.5:/home/user/
```

Copy folder:

```bash
scp -r /path/to/local/folder user@192.168.1.5:/home/user/
```

If SSH port is not 22:

```bash
scp -P 2222 /path/to/file.txt user@192.168.1.5:/home/user/
```

> 💡 Tip:
> You can use your local `$USER` if the remote has the same username:
>
> ```bash
> scp file.txt 192.168.1.5:/home/$USER/
> ```

---

## 🧩 Option 2 — `rsync` (faster and resumable)

Better for big or many files.

```bash
rsync -avP /path/to/local/file.txt user@192.168.1.5:/home/user/
```

Flags:

* `-a` = archive (preserve permissions, timestamps)
* `-v` = verbose
* `-P` = show progress + resume if interrupted

For directories:

```bash
rsync -avP /path/to/folder/ user@192.168.1.5:/home/user/folder/
```

If SSH uses custom port:

```bash
rsync -avP -e "ssh -p 2222" /path/to/folder/ user@192.168.1.5:/home/user/
```

---

## 🧩 Option 3 — `sftp` (interactive file transfer)

```bash
sftp user@192.168.1.5
```

Then inside the prompt:

```
put localfile.txt
get remotefile.txt
ls
cd
exit
```

---

## 🧩 Option 4 — quick one-line SSH pipe (no scp/rsync)

If you only need to send one file and want minimal setup:

```bash
cat file.txt | ssh user@192.168.1.5 "cat > /home/user/file.txt"
```

---

## 🧩 Option 5 — if both are in same LAN and you prefer shared folder

You can also temporarily share a folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

on the sender machine, then on the receiver:

```bash
wget http://192.168.1.10:8000/file.txt
```

(but this is not encrypted, so only use on trusted LANs).

---

## 🔍 Verify SSH works first

Before transferring, always confirm SSH access:

```bash
ssh user@192.168.1.5
```

If that connects, all the above will work.

---

Would you like me to show the **exact `scp` command** for your setup if you tell me:

* sender file path (on Ubuntu)
* receiver IP
* receiver username
* and remote directory you want to copy into?

}



it said to me Permission denied, please try again
{
That message —

```
Permission denied, please try again.
```

— always means SSH authentication failed, **not** a file permission issue.
Let’s quickly find the exact cause and fix it.

---

### 🔍 Step 1: Check SSH connection first

Run:

```bash
ssh user@192.168.1.5
```

Replace `user` and `192.168.1.5` with your target.

* If it **asks for a password**, type it carefully.
* If it still says “Permission denied”, then:

  * Either the **username or password is wrong**, or
  * Password login is **disabled** on the remote SSH server, or
  * You need to use an **SSH key** instead of password.

---

### 🧭 Step 2: Confirm the right username

On the remote machine, run:

```bash
whoami
```

That gives the correct username you should use from the sender.

For example, if it shows `mohsen`, use:

```bash
scp file.txt mohsen@192.168.1.5:/home/mohsen/
```

---

### 🧱 Step 3: Check remote SSH config

On the **target** machine (the one you’re copying *to*), check:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Look for these lines:

```
PasswordAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin yes
```

If either is `no`, change to `yes` (if you want to allow password login), then restart SSH:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

---

### 🗝 Step 4: (Alternative) Use SSH key login

If the remote doesn’t allow password login, use an SSH key:

On the **sending** machine:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
ssh-copy-id user@192.168.1.5
```

Then try:

```bash
ssh user@192.168.1.5
```

It should log in without password. Then `scp` will work fine too.

---

### 🧩 Step 5: File permission confusion

If SSH **logs in fine**, but scp still says permission denied *after login*, then the issue is with the **remote path**, not authentication.

For example:

```
scp file.txt user@192.168.1.5:/root/
```

will fail unless you’re root.
Instead use:

```
scp file.txt user@192.168.1.5:/home/user/
```

---

If you show me the **exact command you ran** and **exact message output**, I can tell you in one line what’s wrong (username, path, or SSH setting).
Can you paste that here?
