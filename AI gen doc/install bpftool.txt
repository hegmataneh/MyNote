If you get the error:

```
Package 'bpftool' has no installation candidate
```

…it means the package is either **not available in your current APT sources** or you're on an older version of Ubuntu that doesn't have it in the default repositories.

---

### ✅ Solution 1: Use `linux-tools` (recommended)

`bpftool` is part of `linux-tools-<version>`. Run:

```bash
uname -r
```

For example, if the output is `5.15.0-100-generic`, then install:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install linux-tools-5.15.0-100-generic
```

After that, you’ll find `bpftool` at:

```bash
/usr/lib/linux-tools-*/bpftool
```

To make it globally available:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/linux-tools-$(uname -r)/bpftool /usr/local/bin/bpftool
```

---

### ✅ Solution 2: Install from source

If your kernel tools package doesn’t include `bpftool` or you want the latest version:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git clang llvm libelf-dev libbpf-dev build-essential pahole

git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/libbpf/bpftool
cd bpftool/src
make
sudo make install
```

After this, you can use `bpftool` from anywhere.

---

### ✅ Confirm it works

```bash
bpftool version
```

Let me know your Ubuntu version (`lsb_release -a`) if you still hit issues.
