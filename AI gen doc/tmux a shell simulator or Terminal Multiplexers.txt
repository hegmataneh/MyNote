if i had ssh session to vm and run app in that session. if i close ssh or hibernate host of ssh . then is that running ap closed
{

That depends on **how** you run the app in your SSH session.

By default, yes — if you just run:

```bash
./my_app
```

and then close the SSH session or hibernate the host, the process will receive a **SIGHUP** (hangup signal) and terminate.

But you can make it keep running even after SSH disconnects:

---

### 1. **Use `nohup`**

Prevents SIGHUP from killing the process:

```bash
nohup ./my_app > output.log 2>&1 &
```

* `nohup` ignores hangup signals
* `&` runs in background
* Process keeps running after SSH closes

---

### 2. **Use `disown`**

Start normally, then detach from shell:

```bash
./my_app &
disown
```

Now the process is no longer tied to the SSH session.

---

### 3. **Use a Terminal Multiplexer (`screen` or `tmux`)**

Start a persistent shell session that survives disconnects:

```bash
tmux
./my_app
```

Then you can detach with `Ctrl+B D`, disconnect SSH, reconnect later and run:

```bash
tmux attach
```

to rejoin the session.

---

### 4. **Systemd Service**

For long-running apps, create a systemd service so it runs in the background like a daemon and auto-starts on boot.

---

### Hibernate Case

If you **hibernate the SSH client machine**, but keep the SSH connection open (not killed by network timeout), the session might stay alive.
But usually the network will break during hibernation → SSH session drops → process dies unless you used `nohup`, `disown`, or `tmux`.

---

Do you want me to show you the simplest solution (minimal change to your current workflow) or the most reliable (safe for long-term running apps)?


}


if i do disown then hot to query system that my app still running
{

Good question — once you run `disown`, the process is detached from your shell, so you can’t bring it back with `fg` or `jobs`.
But you can still check if it’s running using standard Linux tools.

---

### 1. **Check by Process Name**

If your app is called `my_app`:

```bash
ps -ef | grep my_app
```

Example output:

```
user     12345     1  0 17:01 ?        00:00:01 ./my_app
```

The number after your username (`12345`) is the PID (process ID).
If you see it, it’s still running.

---

### 2. **Check by PID (If You Saved It)**

When you start the process:

```bash
./my_app &
echo $!
```

This prints the PID of the background job.
Then later you can check:

```bash
ps -p <PID>
```

If it shows info, it’s running. If it says “no such process”, it’s gone.

---

### 3. **Check with `pgrep`**

Shortcut to find by name:

```bash
pgrep -a my_app
```

Shows PID and command line.

---

### 4. **Check Resource Usage**

```bash
top -p <PID>
```

or simply:

```bash
htop
```

and search (`/`) for `my_app`.

---

Would you like me to give you a **one-liner** that runs your app in background, disowns it, and logs the PID automatically so you can check later?


}



is that a way to bring it forward and see stdout and view of app
{

If you use **`disown`**, unfortunately **no — you cannot bring it back to the foreground** or reattach its stdout/stderr to your current shell.
`disown` just removes the job from the shell’s job table, so you lose the connection to its input/output streams.
The process will keep running, but you won’t see its live output anymore.

---

### If You Want to Reattach Later (Recommended)

Use **`tmux`** or **`screen`** instead of `disown`.
These let you detach/reattach and keep full control of the program, including its stdout/stderr.

Example with `tmux`:

```bash
tmux new -s mysession
./my_app
```

Then press `Ctrl+B` followed by `D` to detach.
Later (even after SSH reconnect):

```bash
tmux attach -t mysession
```

You will see the program’s live output, just like you never left.

---

### If You Already Used `disown`

You can still read the output if you redirected it to a file:

```bash
./my_app > my_app.log 2>&1 &
disown
```

Then later:

```bash
tail -f my_app.log
```

But you cannot interact with it (send keystrokes, etc.) or see live stdout in the same terminal session — only the file contents.

---

So:

* **disown** = keeps running but no reattach
* **nohup** = keeps running but no reattach
* **tmux/screen** = keeps running AND you can reattach, see output, interact

---

Do you want me to give you a minimal `tmux` workflow so you can use it quickly without learning too many commands?


}


if my app is Protocol_Bridge.out help me use tmux to put it in background and bring it back again
{

Got it — here’s a **minimal tmux workflow** for running `Protocol_Bridge.out` in the background and reattaching later.

---

### Step 1 — Start a tmux session

```bash
tmux new -s bridge
```

* `bridge` is just the session name (you can pick any name).
* You will now be inside tmux (looks just like a normal shell).

---

### Step 2 — Run your app inside tmux

```bash
./Protocol_Bridge.out
```

It will run and show output normally.

---

### Step 3 — Detach (put tmux in background)

Press:
**`Ctrl + B`** (release both) then press **`D`**

You will see:

```
[detached (from session bridge)]
```

Your app keeps running in the background — even if you close SSH.

---

### Step 4 — Reattach later

Reconnect to your VM via SSH, then run:

```bash
tmux attach -t bridge
```

You’ll be back inside the same session, seeing the live output.

---

### Extra Tips

* If you forget the session name:

```bash
tmux ls
```

This lists all tmux sessions.
Then attach:

```bash
tmux attach -t <session-name>
```

* If you want multiple tmux sessions, give each a different name:

```bash
tmux new -s something_else
```

* To completely kill the session (and the app inside):

```bash
tmux kill-session -t bridge
```

---

Would you like me to give you a **single command** that starts tmux, runs `Protocol_Bridge.out`, and leaves it running (so you can attach later with no extra steps)?


}


why ctrl B not work
{

Good catch — if **Ctrl +B** doesn’t seem to work, there are a few possible reasons. Let’s troubleshoot and fix it:

---

### 1. Confirm You’re Really Inside `tmux`

After running:

```bash
tmux new -s bridge
```

you should see a new shell. Usually, tmux adds a small status bar at the bottom (often shows `[bridge]` and time).
If you don’t see that bar, you might not actually be inside tmux.

Check with:

```bash
echo $TERM
```

If it says `screen` or `tmux-256color`, you are in tmux.
If it just says `xterm` or similar, you never entered tmux — re-run `tmux new -s bridge`.

---

### 2. Correct Key Sequence

Detaching requires two steps (not holding keys together):

1. **Hold Ctrl**, press **B**, then release both keys
2. Press **D**

You should see:

```
[detached (from session bridge)]
```

---

### 3. If Ctrl +B Is Remapped or Colliding

Some terminal emulators or configs remap tmux’s prefix key.
Check your prefix key with:

```bash
tmux list-keys | grep detach
```

You should see something like:

```
bind-key -T prefix d detach-client
```

Meaning `prefix` + `d` detaches.
If prefix is remapped, check:

```bash
tmux show -g prefix
```

Default is `C-b` (Control-B).
If it shows something else (e.g., `C-a`), then use that instead.

---

### 4. Alternative Detach Command

You can always detach without using the key combo:

```bash
tmux detach
```

Type that inside tmux — it does the same thing as Ctrl +B, D.

---

### Quick Test

Try this sequence step by step:

```bash
tmux new -s test
```

Then inside tmux, type:

```bash
tmux detach
```

If you see `[detached]`, it worked — then you can reattach with:

```bash
tmux attach -t test
```

---

Do you want me to show you how to make **tmux automatically start `Protocol_Bridge.out`** when you create the session (so you don’t have to type anything inside)?
