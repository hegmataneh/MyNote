how to make ubuntu applicable to use libpcap
{
	You don’t need anything exotic—on Ubuntu “making it applicable to use libpcap” mostly boils down to installing the libraries, handling permissions, and (if you’re compiling) linking correctly. Here are the common steps and tips:

	---

	### 1. Install libpcap and build tools

	```bash
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install libpcap-dev build-essential pkg-config
	```

	* `libpcap-dev` gives you headers and the static/linkable library.
	* `build-essential` gives you gcc/make.
	* `pkg-config` helps discover compiler/linker flags.

	You can verify the installed libpcap version with:

	```bash
	pkg-config --modversion libpcap
	```

	---

	### 2. Using existing tools (e.g., `tcpdump` or `wireshark`)

	```bash
	sudo apt install tcpdump wireshark
	```

	* `tcpdump` is a libpcap-based CLI sniffer.

	* For non-root captures with `wireshark`/`dumpcap`, run:

	  ```bash
	  sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
	  sudo usermod -a -G wireshark $USER
	  ```

	  Then log out and back in. That lets a regular user capture without full root.

	* To allow a binary like `tcpdump` to capture without running as root:

	  ```bash
	  sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/sbin/tcpdump
	  ```

	---

	### 3. Compiling a simple C program with libpcap

	Example `capture.c`:

	```c
	#include <pcap.h>
	#include <stdio.h>

	int main() {
		char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
		pcap_if_t *alldevs;

		if (pcap_findalldevs(&alldevs, errbuf) == -1) {
			fprintf(stderr, "Error finding devices: %s\n", errbuf);
			return 1;
		}

		printf("Available interfaces:\n");
		for (pcap_if_t *d = alldevs; d; d = d->next) {
			printf("  %s: %s\n", d->name, d->description ? d->description : "(no desc)");
		}

		pcap_freealldevs(alldevs);
		return 0;
	}
	```

	Compile it with:

	```bash
	gcc -o capture capture.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libpcap)
	```

	Run (needs privileges to open interfaces):

	```bash
	sudo ./capture
	```

	Or give the binary capture capability instead of sudo:

	```bash
	sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip ./capture
	./capture
	```

	---

	### 4. Permissions for packet capture

	Raw packet capture requires privileges. Options:

	* Run your binary as `root` (e.g., via `sudo`).
	* Grant only the needed capability:

	  ```bash
	  sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip /path/to/your_binary
	  ```
	* For GUI tools like Wireshark, use the `wireshark` group as above.

	Check current capabilities with:

	```bash
	getcap ./your_binary
	```

	---

	### 5. Python / higher-level bindings (optional)

	If you want to use libpcap from Python, common approaches:

	* `pcapy` (bindings to libpcap): install via `pip install pcapy` (you still need `libpcap-dev`).
	* `pyshark`: a wrapper around tshark, doesn’t use libpcap directly but useful for analysis.

	---

	### 6. Troubleshooting

	* **“pcap.h: No such file or directory”** → `libpcap-dev` not installed.
	* **Linker errors (`undefined reference to pcap_*`)** → forgot `-lpcap` or incorrect pkg-config usage; use `$(pkg-config --cflags --libs libpcap)`.
	* **Cannot capture: Permission denied** → either run as root or grant capability (see above).
	* **Interface list empty / no packets** → check with `tcpdump -D` to list interfaces and ensure interface is up.

	---

	### Summary checklist

	* [x] `sudo apt install libpcap-dev build-essential pkg-config`
	* [x] Compile with `pkg-config` to get flags.
	* [x] Handle privileges (root or `setcap`).
	* [x] For user-friendly captures, configure Wireshark group.
	* [x] Verify with simple program or `tcpdump -D`.

	If you tell me more about your use case (e.g., writing a program in C/Python, using tcpdump, embedding in an app, needing non-root capture), I can tailor a concrete example or help debug an error you’re seeing.

}

in linking step it says "undefined reference to `pcap_lookupnet'"
{
	That error means you’re not linking against libpcap properly. `pcap_lookupnet` is in libpcap, so the linker can’t find it unless you add `-lpcap` (and in the right place).

	**Fixes:**

	1. **Preferred / foolproof way (uses pkg-config):**

	   ```bash
	   gcc -o capture capture.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libpcap)
	   ```

	   This injects the needed `-I` include flags and `-lpcap` (and any other required flags) in the correct order.

	2. **Manually if not using pkg-config:**

	   ```bash
	   gcc -o capture capture.c -lpcap
	   ```

	   *Important:* `-lpcap` must come **after** the source/object files. If you do `-lpcap capture.c` you’ll get the same undefined reference.

	3. **If using g++ (C++), same idea:**

	   ```bash
	   g++ -o capture capture.cpp $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libpcap)
	   ```

	4. **Verify `libpcap-dev` is installed** (headers alone won’t suffice):

	   ```bash
	   sudo apt install libpcap-dev
	   ```

	5. **Check what pkg-config outputs:**

	   ```bash
	   pkg-config --cflags --libs libpcap
	   ```

	   You should see something like `-I/usr/include -lpcap` etc. If that fails, ensure `pkg-config` is installed and that `libpcap.pc` exists (comes from `libpcap-dev`).

	6. **Example snippet using `pcap_lookupnet`:**

	   ```c
	   #include <pcap.h>
	   #include <stdio.h>
	   #include <stdlib.h>

	   int main() {
		   char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
		   char *dev = pcap_lookupdev(errbuf);
		   if (!dev) {
			   fprintf(stderr, "No device: %s\n", errbuf);
			   return 1;
		   }
		   bpf_u_int32 net, mask;
		   if (pcap_lookupnet(dev, &net, &mask, errbuf) == -1) {
			   fprintf(stderr, "Lookupnet failed: %s\n", errbuf);
			   net = mask = 0;
		   }
		   printf("Device: %s\n", dev);
		   return 0;
	   }
	   ```

	   Compile with the pkg-config form above.

	If you’re still getting the error, paste the exact compile command you used and the full error message and I’ll help you debug the ordering or missing pieces.

}

can you please tell me how to be sure that "tcpdump is a libpcap-based CLI sniffer"
{
	Yes. You can be sure in three independent ways: documentation/source, build/runtime inspection, and understanding what tools like `strace` actually show.

	#### 1. **Authoritative documentation / source**

	* The official description (e.g., on the tcpdump project / Wikipedia) states that **tcpdump uses libpcap to capture packets**; WinDump on Windows uses WinPcap which is the Windows port of libpcap. ([Wikipedia][1])
	* Linux distro docs (e.g., Red Hat’s intro to tcpdump) explicitly say “Tcpdump requires libpcap, a library for network packet capture.” ([Red Hat][2])

	You can also browse the tcpdump source tree on the official site (tcpdump.org) and see it calling `pcap_*` APIs (e.g., `pcap_open_live`, `pcap_compile`, etc.)—those are libpcap functions.

	#### 2. **Verify on your machine (runtime/linking)**

	Run these commands:

	* **Show version and linked libpcap:**

	  ```bash
	  tcpdump --version
	  ```

	  Output includes something like:

	  ```
	  tcpdump version 4.x.x
	  libpcap version 1.y.z
	  ```

	  That proves it was built against libpcap. ([Stack Overflow][3])

	* **Check dynamic linkage:**

	  ```bash
	  ldd $(which tcpdump) | grep pcap
	  ```

	  You should see a line like:

	  ```
	  libpcap.so.1 => /usr/lib/.../libpcap.so.1 (0x...)
	  ```

	  confirming that the tcpdump binary is dynamically linked to libpcap.

	* **Inspect required symbols (optional/deeper):**

	  ```bash
	  readelf -Ws $(which tcpdump) | grep pcap_
	  ```

	  or

	  ```bash
	  nm -D $(which tcpdump) | grep pcap
	  ```

	  You’ll see references to the libpcap symbols it uses.

	#### 3. **Why strace might not show libpcap function calls**

	If you tried `strace tcpdump` and didn’t see calls to `pcap_*` functions, that’s expected: `strace` traces **system calls** (like `read`, `ioctl`, `mmap`), not user-space library function invocations. The `pcap_*` functions live in user space inside libpcap; their internal logic ultimately issues system calls to the kernel to fetch packets. So you will see the underlying syscalls but not a line saying `pcap_open_live(...)` in `strace` output. The StackExchange discussion of that confusion is consistent with this explanation. ([Unix & Linux Stack Exchange][4])

	---

	**Summary checklist to be sure:**

	* [ ] `tcpdump --version` shows a libpcap version. ([Stack Overflow][3])
	* [ ] `ldd $(which tcpdump)` lists `libpcap.so`.
	* [ ] Source/docs (Wikipedia / Red Hat blog / tcpdump.org) state dependence on libpcap. ([Red Hat][2], [Wikipedia][1])
	* [ ] Understand `strace`’s scope so you’re not expecting it to log library-level function calls. ([Unix & Linux Stack Exchange][4])

	If you paste the actual outputs of your `tcpdump --version` and `ldd` commands, I can help interpret them to confirm.
