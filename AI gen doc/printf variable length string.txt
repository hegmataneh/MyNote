in c language how can printf with "%.*s" and rest of string fill with spaces
{
In C, the `"%.*s"` format in `printf` is used to print a **string with a precision specifier** (i.e., a maximum number of characters).

But if you want to **print a string padded with spaces up to some fixed width**, you need to combine it with the **field width specifier**.

---

### Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    const char *text = "hello";
    int width = 10;   // total field width
    int len = 3;      // number of chars from text to print

    printf("|%*.*s|\n", width, len, text);
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Explanation of `"%*.*s"`

* First `*` → field width (here `10`)
* Second `*` → precision (maximum number of characters to print, here `3`)
* `"s"` → string

So this prints only **3 characters** from `"hello"` → `"hel"`,
but ensures the output is **10 characters wide**, padding the rest with spaces.

Output:

```
|       hel|
```

---

✅ If you want **left-aligned padding**, use `%-*.*s` instead:

```c
printf("|%-*.*s|\n", width, len, text);
```

Output:

```
|hel       |
```

---

Do you want the **spaces always after the string** (right-padding), or is left-padding acceptable too?
