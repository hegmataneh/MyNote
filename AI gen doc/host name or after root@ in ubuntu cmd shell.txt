how in ubuntu linux instead of root@s6-db write root@168_6_2
{

You can change what appears after `@` in your Linux shell prompt by editing the **hostname** or **PS1 prompt**.

Here are **two methods**, depending on what you actually want:

---

### 🟢 **Option 1: Change the system hostname**

This changes it system-wide (affects SSH, terminal prompt, etc.)

1. Check your current hostname:

   ```bash
   hostname
   ```

   Example output: `s6-db`

2. Set a new hostname (temporarily until reboot):

   ```bash
   sudo hostname 168_6_2
   ```

3. To make it **permanent**, edit `/etc/hostname`:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/hostname
   ```

   Replace its content with:

   ```
   168_6_2
   ```

   Then edit `/etc/hosts` and update the line with your old hostname, e.g.:

   ```
   127.0.1.1   168_6_2
   ```

4. Apply changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
   ```

   or simply reboot.

✅ After that, your prompt should show:

```
root@168_6_2:~#
```

---

### 🟡 **Option 2: Just customize the prompt (temporary or per-user)**

If you don’t want to change the system hostname, just modify the shell prompt.

To test it temporarily:

```bash
export PS1="\u@168_6_2:\w\$ "
```

To make it permanent for `root`, add that line to:

```bash
nano /root/.bashrc
```

or for your user:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Then reload:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

✅ Your prompt will show `root@168_6_2` but the real hostname stays `s6-db`.

Would you like me to make it system-wide (affect SSH and `hostname` command) or just in your terminal prompt?
