in ubuntu get me list of users
{
	In Ubuntu, you can list all users in several ways. The most common is to read the `/etc/passwd` file, which stores user account information.

	**Command:**

	```bash
	cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
	```

	This will print just the usernames.

	If you also want to see details such as UID, home directory, and shell:

	```bash
	cat /etc/passwd
	```

	For **only human users** (with UID â‰¥ 1000 and not system accounts), you can filter:

	```bash
	awk -F: '$3 >= 1000 {print $1}' /etc/passwd
	```

	Do you want me to also show you **their privilege level** so you can see which ones have `sudo` access?
