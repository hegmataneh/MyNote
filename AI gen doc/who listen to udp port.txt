check who listen to any udp port
{
You can check which process is listening on any UDP port with several commands.
Here are the most common and reliable ones for Linux:

---

### 1. **Using `ss` (recommended, modern way)**

```bash
sudo ss -ulpn
```

* `-u` → Show UDP sockets
* `-l` → Only listening sockets
* `-p` → Show process using the socket
* `-n` → Show port numbers instead of service names

**Example output:**

```
State  Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address:Port  Peer Address:Port  Process
UNCONN 0      0      0.0.0.0:12345      0.0.0.0:*      users:(("myudpapp",pid=1234,fd=5))
```

---

### 2. **Using `lsof`**

```bash
sudo lsof -iUDP -nP
```

* `-iUDP` → Show UDP sockets
* `-nP` → No DNS lookup, show numeric ports

You’ll get a list of all processes with UDP sockets open (both listening and connected).

---

### 3. **Using `netstat` (older tool, still available)**

```bash
sudo netstat -ulnp
```

* `-u` → UDP
* `-l` → Listening
* `-n` → Numeric ports
* `-p` → Show PID/program

---

Would you like me to show you a command that **filters for a specific UDP port** (e.g., `10200`)? That way you can quickly check if something is listening there.
