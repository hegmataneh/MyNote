To fix or enable command **auto-completion** in Ubuntu shell (usually **bash** or **zsh**), follow these steps:

---

### âœ… For **Bash Shell** (default in Ubuntu):

#### 1. **Install bash-completion**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install bash-completion
```

#### 2. **Enable bash-completion in `.bashrc`**

Open the file:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Ensure this block exists and is **not commented out**:

```bash
if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
    . /etc/bash_completion
fi
```

Then **reload** the config:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### 3. **Test Auto-Completion**

Try typing:

```bash
sudo apt ins[TAB]
```

It should complete to:

```bash
sudo apt install
```

---

### âœ… For **Zsh Shell** (if you use zsh):

#### 1. Install `zsh` and `oh-my-zsh` (optional, but powerful)

```bash
sudo apt install zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Zsh comes with powerful auto-completion.

### ðŸ§ª Extra Tips:

* **Tab key** is used for auto-completion.
* Press `[TAB][TAB]` to list possible completions.
* Auto-completion works for:

  * Commands
  * Files
  * Paths
  * Installed packages
  * Git branches (if enabled)
  * Docker/Kubectl/... (if completion scripts are sourced)

---

If it still doesn't work, tell me:

* Your shell (`echo $SHELL`)
* Your Ubuntu version (`lsb_release -a`)
  So I can help more precisely.
