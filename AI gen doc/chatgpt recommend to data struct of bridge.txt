i want data structure good for RAM memory that persist continuesly received packet and can satisfy my goal. that goal are tell after second data structure i need. i need another structure simoultanously with ram DS and if ram data stored to much time the are transport to persistent storage like hard and ram buffer get free. so with this system in no cituation my app loose data receice because ram is full and no storage to save data. my goad are: this system is very flecible with amoun of ram and hard and can expand automatically. data structure has less fragment memory so memory access does not decay in time. this structure must resist in high rate data receive so my combination of data structure can resist in peak data. there is also reader on memories that read data and send them by network  to another place and after send them and confident about passing well remove it from each buffer that persist that data. there is no chance that come cituation that nned just remove one item from middle of buffered data. so reader just read from last prev location it left and read and send it through packet to third place. there is no random access to any item and read and write it continuesly. there is long term needed buffer so memory exhaustion must be prevented.

Nice — you described a classic high-throughput, lossless, append-only ingestion pipeline. Below I give a concrete, production-style design (C-friendly) that meets your constraints: continuous append, no in-middle deletes, spill-to-disk when RAM is full, low fragmentation, high throughput, sequential readers, and durable offsets so nothing is lost.

# Short summary (one-line)

Use a **segmented append-only in-memory log + disk-backed segmented log** with fixed-size slabs/pages and sequential readers that store offsets durably. Move *whole* in-memory segments to disk when memory pressure hits a threshold — never delete an item from the middle.

---

# Key ideas (why this fits your goals)

* **Append-only segmented log**: writer only appends; readers only advance a sequential offset. No random deletes => simple and fast.
* **Segments (fixed-size chunks)**: group many packets into a contiguous block (e.g., 64MB). Moving a segment to disk releases a large contiguous region — minimal fragmentation.
* **Slab / fixed-size block allocator** for packet payloads (or contiguous pack-in-segment) reduces heap fragmentation.
* **Single-Producer/Single-Consumer (SPSC) or sharded queues**: lock-free for max throughput; use multiple shards for multi-producer scale.
* **Disk persistence = segmented files**: write each full (or aged) segment to disk as a file (append-only). Readers can mmap or sequential-read segments for efficient I/O.
* **Durable offset checkpoint**: readers persist their read-offsets (e.g., per-reader checkpoint file) only after successful network send, so on restart they resume.
* **Move whole segments only**: simplifies correctness and avoids per-item disk operations; avoids need to delete middle items.
* **Backpressure / autoscaling**: if both RAM & disk full, you must either block producers or scale/allocate more disk. Design assumes you can block or throttle upstream; otherwise you'll need more nodes.

# Components & responsibilities

1. **In-memory buffer manager (IMBM)**

   * Maintains `N` segments in RAM (ring of segment slots). Each segment = contiguous byte array + header metadata (base offset, write pointer, packet count).
   * Append operation writes to current segment; if segment full -> seal it and start next segment. If no free RAM segment -> trigger flush-to-disk of oldest sealed segment OR block producer until freed (configurable).
   * Uses preallocated segments (e.g., allocate `N` segments at startup) or dynamic allocation with upper bound.

2. **Slab/allocator or pack-in-segment**

   * Pack packet length and bytes directly into the segment sequentially (header + payload), avoiding per-packet malloc. This is the least-fragmenting approach.

3. **Segment flusher (to disk)**

   * Background thread that takes sealed segments and writes them as files `segment_{base_offset}.seg` in append-only directory. Use atomic file rename or write to tmp then rename. Optionally use `fsync` policy for durability.
   * After flush and (optionally) verification, free RAM segment or reuse it as a new segment.

4. **Persistent store (disk)**

   * Directory of segment files (ordered by base offset). Each file is append-only and immutable after creation.
   * Optionally support compression on file write (if CPU permits).

5. **Reader(s) / Network sender**

   * Each reader holds a durable `offset` (global logical offset in bytes or packet index). It reads sequentially from current offset:

     * If offset is within in-memory segments -> read directly from memory.
     * If offset is in disk segments -> read from files (mmap or sequential read).
   * After reader successfully sends a packet and confirms delivery (depending on protocol), it advances offset and persists checkpoint (e.g., write-to-offset file + fsync).
   * Old segments (all readers have advanced past them) can be deleted from disk.

6. **Metadata manager**

   * Records mapping: `segment base offset -> segment state (in-memory, sealed, flushed file path, readers-remaining)`.
   * Maintains low-overhead reference counts / min-reader-offset to know when files can be deleted.

---

# Concrete data layout (C-friendly)

Use a single global monotonically increasing `log_offset` (64-bit), count bytes appended. Each appended packet becomes a record:

```
[ 8-byte packet_len ][ 8-byte log_offset ][ packet_len bytes payload ]
```

Records are packed back-to-back inside a segment buffer.

## C struct prototypes (illustrative)

```c
// config
#define SEGMENT_SIZE (64 * 1024 * 1024) // 64 MB, tunable
#define MAX_SEGMENTS_IN_RAM 4          // tunable per RAM

typedef struct {
    uint64_t base_offset;   // offset of first byte in this segment
    size_t   write_pos;     // bytes written in segment
    size_t   capacity;      // SEGMENT_SIZE
    char    *buffer;        // pointer to contiguous memory
    bool     sealed;        // no further writes
    bool     on_disk;       // already flushed to disk
    char     filename[256]; // disk filename if flushed
} segment_t;

typedef struct {
    segment_t segments[MAX_SEGMENTS_IN_RAM]; // ring
    size_t    head_idx;   // index for next write segment
    size_t    tail_idx;   // oldest sealed segment
    uint64_t  next_offset; // next log_offset to assign
    pthread_mutex_t lock;  // for simple multi-producer; prefer lock-free/sharded
} log_store_t;
```

# Append (writer) pseudocode

* Try to reserve space in `segments[head]`. If not enough space:

  * seal head segment (`sealed = true`), advance head to next segment.
  * If new head segment is currently in use (not free), **trigger flush** of oldest sealed segment or block/wait until free (preferable to flush).
* Append record: write header + payload at `write_pos`, increment `write_pos`, assign `log_offset` ranges.

Important: use batching. Combine multiple packets per syscall when flushing to disk and when sending over network.

---

# Flusher pseudocode

* Background thread polls `tail_idx` for sealed segments that are not yet on disk.
* For each sealed segment:

  * Write to temporary file `tmp_{base_offset}.seg` with single large write(s) (use `pwrite`/`writev`), then `fsync(fd)`, then `rename(tmp, final)`.
  * Mark segment `on_disk=true` and release its RAM buffer if configured; OR reuse buffer as a new empty segment (reset write\_pos, update base\_offset) after ensuring disk copy is complete and readers can read from disk.

Note: For maximum read performance, keep segment in memory until at least one reader has advanced past it, but you can also rely entirely on disk if desired.

---

# Reader semantics

* Reader tracks `reader_offset` (64-bit). To read next record:

  * Locate segment that contains `reader_offset` (use `base_offset` range). If in-memory -> read from buffer; else open mapped file or read with buffered I/O.
  * Parse `[len][offset]` then read payload and send it.
  * After confirmed transmit, advance `reader_offset` and periodically persist to a checkpoint file (e.g., every N bytes or N records) and fsync the checkpoint.
* Use durable storage of reader\_offset so crash/resume is safe.

---

# Avoiding fragmentation & maximizing throughput

* **Preallocate segments** (`malloc` big contiguous blocks) to avoid many small heap allocations. Allocating large segments reduces fragmentation.
* **Pack payloads inside segments** instead of allocating each payload separately. No per-packet `malloc`/`free`.
* **Slab allocator** if variable-size small objects are necessary — pre-create pools of, e.g., 256B/1KB/4KB chunks.
* **Use power-of-two segment sizes** and align to page boundaries; consider using huge pages if available.
* **Batching**: write many records in one syscall when flushing to disk; send many records together over network.
* **I/O optimizations**: use `O_DIRECT` or `mmap` for large sequential reads/writes; ensure alignment rules if using `O_DIRECT`. Use `fsync` frequency based on durability vs throughput tradeoff.

---

# Concurrency / scale

* Single-producer: very simple lock-free SPSC circular segment. Multi-producer: create *per-producer* append shards (per-core queues) and a combined flusher; this avoids contention.
* For many readers: shard log into multiple partitions by key to parallelize, or use a single global log with multiple readers (each maintains offset).
* For very high ingest rates, use network load balancing to multiple ingestion nodes, each owning some partition.

---

# Failure modes & how the design prevents data loss

* **Writer crashes after append but before flush**: if in-memory only, data lost. Solutions:

  * Use memory-backed `mmap` to file (or write-through to disk) for hard durability, OR periodically flush sealed segments to disk as soon as possible.
  * If absolutely no loss allowed, fsync new data to disk before acknowledging upstream; otherwise you must accept that some recent in-memory packets might be lost if process dies.
* **Reader crash**: checkpointed `reader_offset` ensures resume from correct position. Persist checkpoints frequently enough.
* **Disk full**: you must either throttle producers or scale/out additional disk/instances. This design avoids RAM-only full scenarios by writing sealed segments to disk quickly when RAM pressure grows.

You said “there is no situation my app lose data because ram is full and no storage to save data” — that’s only achievable if you always:

* Guarantee disk space (provisioned or auto-scale), or
* Throttle upstream producers when both RAM and disk are saturated (i.e., apply backpressure).

# Example small C-ish append/read functions (illustrative)

```c
// append packet into current segment (simplified, single-producer)
int append_packet(log_store_t *ls, const void *data, size_t len) {
    segment_t *seg = &ls->segments[ls->head_idx];
    size_t rec_size = sizeof(uint64_t) /*len*/ + sizeof(uint64_t) /*offset*/ + len;
    if (seg->capacity - seg->write_pos < rec_size) {
        // seal and advance head (in real code handle if next segment not free)
        seg->sealed = true;
        ls->head_idx = (ls->head_idx + 1) % MAX_SEGMENTS_IN_RAM;
        seg = &ls->segments[ls->head_idx];
        seg->base_offset = ls->next_offset; // new base
        seg->write_pos = 0;
    }
    uint64_t packet_len = len;
    uint64_t offset = ls->next_offset;
    char *p = seg->buffer + seg->write_pos;
    memcpy(p, &packet_len, sizeof(packet_len)); p += sizeof(packet_len);
    memcpy(p, &offset, sizeof(offset)); p += sizeof(offset);
    memcpy(p, data, len);
    seg->write_pos += rec_size;
    ls->next_offset += rec_size;
    return 0;
}
```

Reader reads the header and payload sequentially and persists its `reader_offset`.

# Practical tuning suggestions (defaults you can change)

* Segment size: 16–256 MB. 64 MB is a good starting point.
* RAM segments count: start with 2–8 depending on RAM. More segments = more in-RAM buffered data.
* Checkpoint frequency: every 1MB or every 1000 records.
* When flushing: write using large writev or single write, then fsync once per segment.
* If latency-critical, flush smaller segments sooner (age-based flush) rather than waiting to fill.

---

# When to use mmap vs simple writes

* `mmap` readers: very fast for random read inside a file; simpler to read sequentially too. If you keep segments immutable files, readers can `mmap` them and parse with pointer arithmetic.
* `write` + `fsync` on flush: simple and reliable for flushing segments.

---

# How to delete old data safely

* Keep per-segment min-reader-offset across all readers. When every reader has `reader_offset > segment_end`, delete segment file and reuse segment slot.

---

# Next steps I can do for you (pick any; I’ll produce now)

* Produce a complete single-file C implementation of:

  * segmented in-memory append-only log,
  * background flusher to disk,
  * single reader that reads sequentially and persists offset.
* Or produce a lock-free SPSC optimized version with per-core shards.
* Or show benchmarks / micro-bench tests and more exact syscall choices.

Tell me which of those you want and I’ll generate the full C code (with the defaults you prefer) right away.
