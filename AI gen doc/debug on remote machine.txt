if i want debug on remote ubuntu machine which tools should be installed on ot
{

To debug C/C++ programs on a **remote Ubuntu machine**, you need a combination of compilers, debuggers, and optionally some development tools. Here’s a structured list:

---

### 1. **Compiler**

* **GCC / G++** – necessary to compile programs with debug symbols.

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install build-essential
  ```

  This installs `gcc`, `g++`, `make`, and some basic libraries.

* Ensure you compile with **debug symbols**:

  ```bash
  gcc -g -o myprog myprog.c
  g++ -g -o myprog myprog.cpp
  ```

---

### 2. **Debugger**

* **GDB (GNU Debugger)** – the standard debugger for C/C++ on Linux.

  ```bash
  sudo apt install gdb
  ```

  Then run:

  ```bash
  gdb ./myprog
  ```

* Optional: **GDB with remote debugging**
  If you want to debug **from your local machine using VS2022 or another IDE**, you can use `gdbserver`:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install gdbserver
  ```

  Example usage:

  ```bash
  gdbserver :1234 ./myprog
  ```

  Then connect from your local IDE with the remote GDB target.

---

### 3. **Profiling / Advanced Debugging Tools** (optional)

* **Valgrind** – for memory leak detection and profiling:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install valgrind
  ```
* **strace / ltrace** – to trace system calls and library calls:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install strace ltrace
  ```
* **perf** – for CPU performance profiling:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install linux-perf
  ```

---

### 4. **IDE / Editor Support**

* If you use **VS2022 Remote Development**, make sure the **C/C++ extension** is installed locally and the remote server is reachable via SSH. VS2022 will handle compiling and debugging through the remote connection.

---

### 5. **Optional Utilities**

* **screen or tmux** – if you need long-running debug sessions over SSH.

  ```bash
  sudo apt install tmux
  ```

---

If you want, I can give you a **ready-to-run command sequence that installs everything needed for remote C/C++ debugging** on Ubuntu. This would set it up in one go. Do you want me to do that?
