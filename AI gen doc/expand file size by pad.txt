Yes — in Linux, you can copy a file to itself in a way that **extends its size** by appending data or padding with zeros.
Here are a few methods:

---

**1. `dd`** – duplicate file content and pad with zeros

```bash
dd if=file.bin of=file.bin bs=1 count=0 seek=10M
```

* `seek=10M` → makes the file size at least 10 MB
* `count=0` → doesn't copy actual data, just expands
* The extra space is filled with zeros (sparse file, no actual disk blocks until written).

---

**2. `truncate`** – fast way to expand

```bash
truncate -s +5M file.bin
```

* Increases file size by 5 MB without changing existing content.
* Also produces a sparse file if the space is not actually written.

---

**3. `cat` to append to itself** – actually duplicates content

```bash
cat file.bin >> file.bin
```

* This will double the file size by appending its own content to itself.
* Works with text or binary files, but can be dangerous if the file is large.

---

If you want a **`cp`-like behavior that copies into itself while expanding**, the closest is:

```bash
cat file >> file
```

but this *really* writes duplicate content, unlike `truncate` which only allocates space.

---

Do you want the file **logically bigger (sparse)** or **physically bigger with repeated content**?
Because the command changes depending on that.
