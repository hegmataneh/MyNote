Network Performance Issues


Issue	Description

Latency	Time delay between sender and receiver

Packet Loss	Packets get lost due to overload, interference, or bad routing
Bandwidth Saturation	Network link is constantly used to max capacity
Bufferbloat	Excessive buffering causes delay (common in routers)

Every network device (routers, switches, NICs, OS sockets) uses buffers.
