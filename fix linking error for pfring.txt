so at linking step ways "/usr/bin/ld : error : /usr/local/lib/libpfring.so: undefined reference to `pcap_compile_nopcap'"
{
	That error means `libpfring.so` expects to use `libpcap`’s symbol `pcap_compile_nopcap` but your link line didn’t pull in libpcap. Fixes (in order):

### 1. Make sure libpcap dev is installed

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install libpcap-dev
```

(On other distros, install the equivalent `libpcap` development package.)

### 2. Compile linking both PF\_RING and libpcap

Simple working link line:

```sh
gcc -o simple_capture simple_capture.c -lpfring -lpcap
```

If that still fails, you can try using pkg-config (if `.pc` files are installed):

```sh
gcc simple_capture.c -o simple_capture $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libpfring libpcap)
```

### 3. Verify shared library dependencies

Check that `libpfring.so` can see libpcap:

```sh
ldd /usr/local/lib/libpfring.so | grep pcap
```

You should see something like `libpcap.so.1 => /usr/lib/...`. If it’s missing, PF\_RING was built without properly linking against libpcap; then you need to **rebuild PF\_RING** after installing `libpcap-dev`:

```sh
cd /path/to/pf_ring/source
make clean
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

### 4. Runtime library path (if needed)

If you installed PF\_RING in `/usr/local/lib` and your system doesn’t pick it up:

```sh
sudo ldconfig          # refresh cache
# or export for current session:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

### Summary

* Install `libpcap-dev`.
* Link with `-lpcap` (e.g., `-lpfring -lpcap`).
* Rebuild PF\_RING if its `.so` was built without libpcap.
* Use `ldd` and `ldconfig` to verify/load shared libs.

If you paste the exact gcc command you used and the full error output after trying `-lpfring -lpcap`, I can tailor the fix further.
