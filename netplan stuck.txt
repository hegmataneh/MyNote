i start ubuntu on virtual machine and it stuck on job systemd-networkd-wait-online.service/start running . how can pass it
{
That “`systemd-networkd-wait-online.service`” message means your Ubuntu VM is hanging while waiting for a network interface to get an IP address.
You can bypass it in a few ways depending on whether you want to **skip it temporarily** or **disable it permanently**.

---

## **1. Temporary Bypass at Boot**

1. When the GRUB boot menu appears, press **`e`** to edit the boot entry.
2. Find the line starting with:

   ```
   linux /boot/vmlinuz-...
   ```
3. Add this at the end:

   ```
   systemd.mask=systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
   ```
4. Press **`Ctrl+X`** or **F10** to boot.

This will skip the wait for this boot only.

---

## **2. Permanent Disable**

Once you get into Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
sudo systemctl mask systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
```

This will stop the service from running at all.

---

## **3. Fix the Underlying Cause**

This service waits for `systemd-networkd` to detect network connectivity.
If you want to keep the service but avoid the hang:

* Ensure your VM's network adapter is connected in VirtualBox (`Settings → Network → Cable Connected`).
* If you use `netplan` with DHCP, make sure the correct interface is configured:

  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/netplan/*.yaml
  ```

  Example DHCP config:

  ```yaml
  network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
      enp0s3:
        dhcp4: true
  ```

  Then apply:

  ```bash
  sudo netplan apply
  ```

---

If you want, I can give you **a GRUB edit trick** that lets you boot immediately without even waiting for the network, so you can fix it inside the system.
Do you want me to give that method?

i type sudo nano /etc/netplan/*.yaml and it open 50-cloud-init.yaml. what is that
{
The file **`/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml`** is created by **cloud-init**, a package that automatically configures networking and other system settings during the first boot (especially in cloud or VM environments).

In Ubuntu Server (and some Desktop installs), **netplan** reads `.yaml` files from `/etc/netplan/` to decide how to configure your network interfaces.
The `50-cloud-init.yaml` file is just one of those config files — it usually comes from cloud-init and contains your network setup, like:

```yaml
network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        enp0s3:
            dhcp4: true
```

---

### Why it matters for your issue

If `50-cloud-init.yaml` is missing a correct interface name or IP configuration, `systemd-networkd-wait-online.service` can hang at boot.

For example, if your VM’s interface name is **`enp0s8`** but the YAML says `enp0s3`, it will wait forever because `enp0s3` doesn’t exist.

---

### You can fix it by:

1. **Check your interface name**:

   ```bash
   ip link
   ```

   Look for something like `enp0s3` or `ens33`.

2. **Edit the YAML**:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
   ```

   Make sure it matches your interface name and has:

   ```yaml
   network:
       version: 2
       ethernets:
           enp0s3:   # Replace with your interface name
               dhcp4: true
   ```

3. **Apply changes**:

   ```bash
   sudo netplan apply
   ```

---

If you want, I can give you the **exact netplan config** that will make your VM boot without waiting for network at all.
Do you want me to do that?
