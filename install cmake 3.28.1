CMake 3.21.0 or higher is required.  You are running version 3.16.3

Right — that error happens because **Ubuntu 20.04 (and earlier)** ships with `cmake 3.16`, but **Notcurses requires ≥ 3.21**.
You can easily fix this by installing a **newer CMake manually**.

Here’s the cleanest and safest way to do it:

---

## ✅ **Option 1: Install latest CMake from Kitware repository (recommended)**

This method gives you an official, maintained version via apt — no manual builds.

```bash
sudo apt remove --purge cmake -y
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common lsb-release gpg

# Add Kitware's official APT repository
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://apt.kitware.com/keys/kitware-archive-latest.asc | \
  sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kitware-archive-keyring.gpg

sudo apt-add-repository \
  "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kitware-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kitware.com/ubuntu/ $(lsb_release -cs) main"

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y cmake
```

Then check version:

```bash
cmake --version
```

You should see **3.28** or newer.

## ✅ **Option 2: Build CMake from source (if repository unavailable)**

If Kitware’s repo doesn’t support your Ubuntu version, build it yourself:

```bash
sudo apt install -y wget build-essential libssl-dev
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.28.1/cmake-3.28.1.tar.gz
tar -xzvf cmake-3.28.1.tar.gz
cd cmake-3.28.1
./bootstrap
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

Then verify:

```bash
cmake --version
```

---

After updating CMake, you can re-run your Notcurses build:

```bash
cd ~/notcurses/build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

---

Would you like me to give you a **script** that automatically installs both the new CMake and Notcurses from source (so you can just run it once)?
